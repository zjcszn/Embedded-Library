 * FUNCTIONS

/** Create the captive port and wait a user to select an available
 * SSID network and enter the corresponding password. Once that has been
 * done the credentials are stored in the WiFi module and it will be
 * restarted to connect to the selected network. The process involves
 * starting a DNS server and a web server to handle the captive portal.
 *
 * This function is NOT threadsafe: there can be only one.
 *
 * Note: this function, internally, calls uNetworkInterfaceUp() and so,
 * if it returns successfully, it is up to you to call
 * uNetworkInterfaceDown() on deviceHandle when done.
 *
 * @param deviceHandle  the handle of the network device instance.
 * @param[in] pSsid     the name of the captive portal (its SSID)
 *                      Can be set to NULL in which case no access
 *                      point will be started, just the web and dns
 *                      server. This is mainly intended for testing.
 * @param[in] pPassword optional password for the portal. Can be set
 *                      to NULL for an open access point.
 * @param cb            callback that may be used to control when
 *                      the captive portal exits; NULL to continue
 *                      until a user selection has occurred (there
 *                      is no timeout).
 * @return              possible negative errors occurring during
 *                      the setup of the portal or when connecting
 *                      using the entered credentials.
 *                      Set to 0 on success.
