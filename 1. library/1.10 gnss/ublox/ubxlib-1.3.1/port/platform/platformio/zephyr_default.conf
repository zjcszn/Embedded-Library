# Default Zephyr settings for ubxlib
# when used with PlatformIO

# Ubxlib uses some special handling of
# the heap on Zephyr. More information
# about this can be found in:
# port/platform/platformio/inc_src.txt

# The default heapsize is kept low in order
# to enable building for boards with low ram
# size. You probably want to change this value
# based on your application requirements.

# Don't want the malloc from minimal libc
CONFIG_MINIMAL_LIBC_MALLOC=n

# Mbed TLS is required by ubxlib
