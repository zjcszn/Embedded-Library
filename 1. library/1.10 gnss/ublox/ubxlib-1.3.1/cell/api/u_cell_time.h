/** Enable CellTime, only supported on SARA-R5.  CellTime is about
 * using the highly accurate cellular network for timing of hardware,
 * using an arbitrary time-base, it is NOT about absolute clock/calender
 * time (UTC or local).
 *
 * If this function returns success it doesn't necessarily mean that
 * the requested CellTime operation has succeeded, since the operation
 * may take a while to complete: please monitor pCallback for progress
 * and for the final outcome; look for the synchronised field of
 * #uCellTimeEvent_t being set to true to indicate "done".
 *
 * You may call this function repeatedly provided the mode doesn't
 * change; if you want to change mode please call uCellTimeDisable()
 * first.
 *
 * Any time pulse will appear on pin number/GPIO ID 19, pin name
 * "GPIO6" of the cellular module.  If the mode is
 * #U_CELL_TIME_MODE_PULSE then for SARA-R5xx-00B the pulse width
 * is fixed at 3 ms and the period 1 second while for SARA-R5xx-01B and
 * later the pulse will be of duration #U_CELL_TIME_PULSE_WIDTH_MILLISECONDS
 * and period #U_CELL_TIME_PULSE_PERIOD_SECONDS.  If the mode is
 * #U_CELL_TIME_MODE_EXT_INT_TIMESTAMP then the input pin is
 * the "EXT_INT" pin of the cellular module, pin number/GPIO ID 33.
 *
 * If the GNSS device is external to the cellular module, two additional
 * pins must be connected: pin number/GPIO ID 46, pin name "SDIO_CMD",
 * must be connected to the GNSS device TIMEPULSE output and pin
 * number/GPIO ID 25, pin name "GPIO4", must be conncted to the
 * GNSS device EXTINT output.
 *
 * If uCellGpioConfig() had previously been called to use the pins
 * in question as user-controllable pins, this will override that
 * setting.
 *
 * If the GNSS device available to the cellular module is already in
 * use for something else (e.g. used by the GNSS API or by Cell Locate)
 * then it cannot also be used for CellTime and hence an error may be
 * returned if cellTimeOnly is set to false.
