/** @file
 * @brief This header file defines functions related to Multiple GNSS
 * Assistance, a u-blox feature which improves the time to first fix
 * (TTFF), which can otherwise be around 30 seconds even in good
 * conditions.
 *
 * To improve TTFF, this MCU can download a few sorts of information to
 * the GNSS module:
 *
 * a) ephemeris data: precise data concerning the orbits of satellites,
 *    valid for a few hours into the future, available from a u-blox
 *    assistance server.
 * b) almanac data: approximate information concerning the orbits of
 *    satellites, valid for up to a few weeks in the future, available
 *    from a u-blox assistance server,
 * c) the current time and approximate current position of the GNSS module,
 *    if not already available in the GNSS module through RTC/battery-backup.
 *
 * In addition, a standard precision u-blox GNSS module can estimate the
 * almanac data by itself (so no connection to a server is required) to
 * achieve an improved TTFF, the data being valid for longer then (a) but
 * shorter than (b), at a penalty of slightly increased power consumption
 * in the GNSS module; let's call this (d).
 *
 * The shortest TTFF (e.g. a few seconds) is achieved if (a) is available,
 * then (e.g. 10 seconds) if (b) is available, then if (d) is switched on.
 * Making (c) available will improve TTFF in all cases and should always
 * be provided first as the assistance information may not be usable without
 * the current time.  (b) is useful in cases where internet connectivity is
 * sporadic.
 *
 * Assistance data can be requested from the u-blox assistance server in
 * two modes:
 *
 * - AssistNow Online: provides the current time, ephemeris and optionally
 *   almanac data.
 * - AssistNow Offline: provides data for up to 5 weeks in advance, hence
 *   the amount of data can be large (e.g. 10 kbytes per week versus
 *   3.5 kbytes total for the online case).
 *
 * In both cases the response is in the form of UBX messages that can be
 * sent directly to the GNSS module.  In the offline case, the data can be
 * stored by this MCU or in flash memory connected to the GNSS module.
 * Communication with the u-blox AssistNow servers is via an HTTP GET request
 * from this MCU; the response will arrive in a single HTTP GET response.
 *
 * Finally, before a GNSS module is powered off, it is possible to read the
 * current assistance database such that it can be restored when the
 * module is powered on again (for the case where there is no flash storage
 * on the GNSS module or battery backup).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: if the GNSS module is connected via an intermediate (e.g. cellular)
 * u-blox module, all of the above can be carried out by the intermediate
 * module instead; no actions by this MCU are required and hence you do not
 * need this API: please use the uCellLoc API instead.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: the AssistNow response consists of many binary
 * messages designed to be sent directly to the GNSS chip.  Forwarding the
 * messages to the GNSS device _will_ require a relatively large amount of
 * heap memory, as will holding the body of the complete single HTTP GET
 * response body from the server; if this causes a problem then please let
 * us know and we will look into optimisation measures.

/** Set (restore) the assistance database to a GNSS device.  Use this

 * Note: if flow control is set to a value other than
 * #U_GNSS_MGA_FLOW_CONTROL_WAIT then, in order to speed up this process
 * when waiting for Acks, NMEA messages from the GNSS chip are temporarily
 * disabled.  You can disable the disabling by defining the conditional
 * compilation flag U_GNSS_MGA_DISABLE_NMEA_MESSAGE_DISABLE.
 *
 * Note: if this function returns #U_GNSS_ERROR_NACK then whatever MGA data
 * _has_ been restored to the GNSS device may still be useful and so it is
 * probably not worth retrying.  Specifically, an intermittent issue has been
 * observed where restoring an MGA DBD record that contains QZSS data (e.g.
 * beginning 03 00 05... where the 03 indicates AUXDB and the 05 indicates QZSS)
 * to a GNSS device of FW version SPG 5.10 results in a NACK; should this occur
 * it is probably best ignored, especially since the QZSS record is usually at
 * the end of the list.
 *
 * Note: not supported if the GNSS device is connected via an intermediate
 * e.g. cellular module; instead please use uCellLocSetAssistNowDatabaseSave().
