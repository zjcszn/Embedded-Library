# The device tree bindings that describe the UART configuration
# of a [separate to the AT interface] PPP connection for cellular;
# uDeviceCfgUart_t (see /common/device/api/u_device.h) but in .yaml
# form, ONLY USED if the interface used for PPP is not the
# same physical interface as the one used for AT.
#
# Note: this is NOTHING TO DO WITH uart-ppp; uart-ppp is a virtual
# thing that Zephyr needs to make a PPP connection, this is the
# physical PPP connection to the module
