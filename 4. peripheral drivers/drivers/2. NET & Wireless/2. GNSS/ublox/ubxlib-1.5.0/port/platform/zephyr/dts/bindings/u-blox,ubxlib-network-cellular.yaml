properties:
# Hidden property: network type
    do-not-set-network-type:
       type: int
       default: 2
       description: "A hidden property: the application should _not_ set this, just allow it to be the default for a cellular network (matches U_NETWORK_TYPE_CELL)."
# APN string
    apn:
        type: string
        description: "The APN for your network; only specify this if your service provider _requires_ you to do so.  If not specified a database look-up will be used, specify \"\" to NOT do a database look-up."
# timeout
    timeout-seconds:
        type: int
        default: 1800
        description: "The timeout when connecting to the network in seconds; this is a LOOONG time in case you are using an NB1 network, where initial search can take many many minutes; if you are NOT using an NB1 network specify a shorter time (e.g. 240 seconds), or alternatively in your code you may specify a timeout callback, see /common/network/api/u_network_config_cell.h."
# username
    username:
        type: string
        description: "ONLY REQUIRED if you must use a user name and password with the APN provided to you by your service provider."

        default: 0
        description: "use 1 for PAP, 2 for CHAP, 3 for automatic (where supported), ONLY REQUIRED if you must give a user name and password with the APN provided to you by your service provider and your cellular module does NOT support figuring out the authentication mode automatically; there is no harm in populating this field even if your module _does_ support figuring out the authentication mode automatically."
# MCC/MNC string
    mccmnc:
        type: string
        description: "ONLY REQUIRED if you want to connect to a specific cellular network (e.g. \"23410\") rather than letting the module just choose the best one."
# Optional PPP UART
    uart-ppp:
        type: phandle
        description: "UART configuration for PPP, ONLY REQUIRED if the PPP interface to the cellular module is different to that of the AT interface, e.g. if the connection to the module is USB, where CMUX is not supported."
