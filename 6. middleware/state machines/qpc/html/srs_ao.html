<h1><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-intro"></a>
Concepts &amp; Definitions</h1>
<p>As described in the <a class="el" href="srs_over.html">Overview</a>, the main goal of the QP Framework is to provide a lightweight and efficient implementation of the <b>Active Object Model of Computation</b> with the specific focus on real-time embedded (RTE) systems, such as single-chip microcontroller units (MCUs).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-model"></a>
Active Object Model of Computation</h2>
<p>The Active Object Model of Computation represents a paradigm shift compared to the traditional "shared state concurrency" based on explicit mutual exclusion and managing threads by blocking. The following subsections describe Active Object properties and explain why this model of computation is <b>safer</b> and makes it easier to write <b>correct concurrent software</b>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-def"></a>
Active Objects</h2>
<p><b>Active Objects</b> (a.k.a., Actors) are autonomous software objects, each possessing an <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-queue">event queue</a> and <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-exec">execution context</a>. They encapsulate state and behavior and communicate <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-asynch">asynchronously</a> by exchanging events. <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_fig-31">Figure SRS-31</a> below shows a QP Application consisting of multiple, event-driven Active Objects that collectively deliver the desired functionality:</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="srs_fig-31"></a></p><div class="image">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="ao_qp.svg" width="1500px" style="pointer-events: none;"></object>
</div>
  <div class="caption"><center><em>Figure SRS-31: Active Objects in QP</em></center></div><h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-enc"></a>
Encapsulation for Concurrency</h2>
<p>The traditional object-oriented encapsulation, as provided by C++, C# or Java, does not really encapsulate anything in terms of <b>concurrency</b>. As shown in <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_fig-32a">Figure SRS-32a</a>, any operation on a <em>passive</em> object still runs in the caller's thread. If that passive object is shared among multiple threads, the object's attributes are subject to the same race conditions as global data, not encapsulated at all. To become concurrency-safe, operations need to be explicitly protected by an appropriate mutual exclusion mechanism, such as a mutex (for threads) or a critical section (for Interrupt Service Routines). However, this reduces responsiveness (blocking or increased latency), causes contention, and often leads to missed real-time deadlines <a class="el" href="srs.html#srs_ref">[Sutter:10]</a>. Also this style of managing concurrency is <b>inherently unsafe</b> because developers might simply forget to apply mutual exclusion or use an incorrect mechanism, which can lead to latent, highly intermittent, hard-to-find and hard-to-fix concurrency bugs.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="srs_fig-32a"></a></p><div class="image">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="seq_thr.svg" width="1500px" style="pointer-events: none;"></object>
</div>
  <div class="caption"><center><em>Figure SRS-32a: Threads interacting (synchronously) with a passive object</em></center></div><p>In contrast, as shown in <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_fig-32b">Figure SRS-32b</a>, all interactions with an <em>Active</em> Object occur by posting events, which are all handled in the execution context of the Active Object. As long as there is no sharing of data or resources among Active Objects (or any other concurrent entities), there are <b>no concurrency hazards</b>. Also, because each event is processed to completion (see <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-rtc">Run-to-Completion processing</a>), event processing is naturally serialized. This means that an Active Object is truly encapsulated without any mutual exclusion mechanisms. In this sense Active Objects are the most stringent form of object-oriented programming because they enable strict <b>encapsulation for concurrency</b>, which is much <b>safer</b> than the "naked" threads.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="srs_fig-32b"></a></p><div class="image">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="seq_ao.svg" width="1500px" style="pointer-events: none;"></object>
</div>
  <div class="caption"><center><em>Figure SRS-32b: Threads interacting (asynchronously) with an Active Object</em></center></div><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Encapsulation for concurrency is not a programming language feature, so it is no more difficult to achieve in C as in C++, but it requires a <b>programming discipline</b> on behalf of the application developers to avoid sharing resources ("shared-nothing" principle). However, the event-based communication helps immensely, because instead of sharing a resource, a dedicated Active Object can become the manager/broker of the resource and the rest of the system can access the resource only via <em>events</em> posted to this broker Active Object.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd>QP Framework by itself cannot and is not required to guarantee or enforce Active Object encapsulation. Achieving the strict encapsulation of Active Objects becomes then the responsibility of the QP Applications. But at the very least, the QP Framework architecture and design must provide adequate and thread-safe <em>event-based</em> information exchange mechanisms, which can replace the traditional sharing of data or resources.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-exec"></a>
Execution Context</h2>
<p>In the UML, Active Object is defined as: <em>"the object having its own thread of control"</em> <a class="el" href="srs.html#srs_ref">[UML 2.5]</a>. A traditional thread might indeed be used for Active Objects when the QP Framework runs on top of a traditional multitasking kernel (e.g., traditional RTOS or general-purpose OS).</p>
<p>However, the Active Object model of computation can also work with real-time kernels that don't necessarily support the notion of traditional <em>blocking</em> threads. Active Objects have <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-block">no need for blocking</a> while handling events, which opens up possibilities of using lightweight, <em>non-blocking</em> kernels that might be cooperative or fully preemptive. (See also lightweight kernels provided in QP, such as <a class="el" href="srs_qv.html">Cooperative Run-to-Completion Kernel</a>, <a class="el" href="srs_qk.html">Preemptive Run-to-Completion Kernel</a>, and <a class="el" href="srs_qxk.html">Preemptive Dual-Mode Kernel</a>.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-prio"></a>
Priority</h2>
<p>The execution context of an Active Object is closely related to its <b>priority</b> relative to other Active Objects or "naked" threads in the system. In fact, an Active Object can be viewed primarily as a <em>priority level</em> for executing the functionality it encapsulates. In the QP Framework, each Active Object is required to have a <b>unique</b> priority. (See also <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#REQ-QP-03_01">REQ-QP-03_01</a>.)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-queue"></a>
Event Queue</h2>
<p>Each Active Object has its own event queue and receives all events exclusively through that queue. This means that the event queue has only a single consumer (the Active Object that owns the queue). On the other hand, the event queue must accommodate multiple producers that don't need to be only Active Objects, but also interrupts (ISRs), or other software components (see <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_fig-31">Figure SRS-31</a>). The Active Object infrastructure, such as the QP Framework in this case, is responsible for delivering and queuing the events in a <em>deterministic</em> and <em>thread-safe</em> manner.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-asynch"></a>
Asynchronous Communication</h2>
<p>All events are delivered to Active Objects <b>asynchronously</b>, meaning that an event producer merely posts an event to the event queue of the recipient Active Object but doesn't wait in line for the actual processing of the event.</p>
<p>The QP Framework makes no distinction between external events generated from interrupts and internal events originating from Active Objects. As shown in <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_fig-31">Figure SRS-31</a>, an Active Object can post events to any other Active Object, including to self. All events are treated uniformly, regardless of their origin.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-rtc"></a>
Run-to-Completion (RTC)</h2>
<p>Each Active Object processes events in <b>run-to-completion (RTC) fashion</b>, which must be guaranteed by the underlying QP Framework. RTC means that Active Objects process the events one at a time and the next event can only be processed after the previous event has been processed completely. RTC event processing is the essential requirement for proper execution of <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-sm">state machines</a>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is very important to clearly distinguish the notion of RTC from the concept of preemption <a class="el" href="srs.html#srs_ref">[OMG 07]</a>. In particular, <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-rtc">RTC</a> does <em>not</em> mean that the Active Object thread has to monopolize the CPU until the RTC step is complete. In fact, RTC steps <em>can</em> be preempted by interrupts or other threads executing on the same CPU. Such thread preemption is determined by the scheduling policy of the underlying multitasking kernel, not by the Active Object model. When the preempted Active Object is assigned the CPU time again, it resumes its event processing from the point of preemption and, eventually, completes its RTC step. As long as the preempting and the preempted threads don't share any resources (see <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-enc">Encapsulation</a>), there are no concurrency hazards.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-curr"></a>
Current Event</h2>
<p>Current event** is the event being processed in the run-to-completion (RTC) step. The event-driven infrastructure (QP Framework in this case) must guarantee that the <em>current event</em> remains available and unchanging for the whole duration of the RTC step.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-block"></a>
No Blocking</h2>
<p>Most traditional operating systems manage the threads and all inter-thread communication based on <em>blocking</em>, such as waiting on a semaphore or a time-delay. However, blocking (as in the middle of the RTC step) is <em>incompatible</em> with the <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-rtc">RTC event processing requirement</a>. This is because every blocking call is really another way to deliver an <em>event</em> (event is delivered by unblocking and return from a blocking call). Such "backdoor" event delivery happening in the middle of the RTC step violates the RTC semantics, because after unblocking the Active Object needs to process two events at a time (the original one and the new one delivered by unblocking).</p>
<p>Another detrimental consequence of blocking (or polling for events) inside RTC steps is that Active Objects become <em>unresponsive</em> to events delivered to their event queues. This, in turn, can cause Active Objects to miss their hard-real time deadlines and also can cause overflow of the internal event queue.</p>
<p>Finally, blocking (or polling for events) means that the expected sequences of events are <em>hard-coded</em>, which is inherently inflexible and not extensible, especially if the system must handle multiple event sequences (which turns out to be the case in most real-life systems).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-sm"></a>
Support For State Machines</h2>
<p>Event-driven components, like Active Objects, must often retain the execution context from one event to the next. This must be done <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-block">without blocking</a>, so the context can't be preserved on the call-stack as it is done in the traditional, blocking RTOS threads. Instead, the context between events must be preserved in some other way, which often leads to multitude of variables and flags checked and modified in a convoluted if-then-else logic (a.k.a. "spaghetti code").</p>
<p>A well know alternative to such "improvised context management" is the concept of a <a class="el" href="srs_sm.html">state machine</a>, which manages the execution context using "states". QP Framework augments and complements the Active Object model of computation by providing support for <a class="el" href="srs_sm.html">state machines</a> to represent the internal behavior of Active Objects.</p>
<dl class="section remark"><dt>Remarks</dt><dd>The relationship between Active Objects and state machines is mutually synergistic. On one hand, the Active Objects provide the execution context and event queuing that the state machines need to process the events in a <a class="el" href="srs_ao.html#srs_ao-rtc">run-to-completion</a> fashion. On the other hand, state machines provide the structure and clear design for the event-driven behavior running inside the Active Objects. State machines are also the most constructive part of the design amenable to modeling and automatic code generation.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-inv"></a>
Inversion of Control</h2>
<p>Event-driven systems require a distinctly different way of thinking than traditional sequential threads. When a sequential thread needs some incoming event, it explicitly <em>blocks</em> and waits in-line until the event arrives. Thus the sequential thread remains "in control" at all times, but while waiting for one kind of event, it cannot respond (at least for the time being) to any other events.</p>
<p>In contrast, most event-driven applications are structured according to the Hollywood principle, which essentially means "Don't call us, we'll call you." So, an event-driven Active Object is not in control while waiting for an event; in fact, it's not even active. Only once the event arrives, the event-driven program is called to process the event and then it quickly relinquishes the control again. This arrangement allows an event-driven program to wait for many events in parallel, so the system remains <em>responsive</em> to all events it needs to handle. This scheme implies that in an event-driven system the control resides within the event-driven infrastructure (QP Framework), rather than in the application. In other words, the control is <em>inverted</em> compared to a traditional sequential thread.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-frame"></a>
Framework vs. Toolkit</h2>
<p>Inversion of control is the key property that makes a software framework different from a software toolkit. A toolkit, such as a traditional RTOS, is essentially a set of predefined functions that you can call. When you use a toolkit, you write the main body of the application, such as the body of all RTOS threads, and call the various blocking functions from the RTOS. When you use a framework (such as QP), you reuse the main body (codified inside the framework) and provide the application code that <em>it</em> calls, so the control resides in the framework rather than in your code. Indeed, this <b>inversion of control</b> gives the event-driven infrastructure all the defining characteristics of a framework:</p>
<p><em>"One important characteristic of a framework is that the methods defined by the user to tailor the framework will often be called from within the framework itself, rather than from the user's application code. The framework often plays the role of the main program in coordinating and sequencing application activity. This &lt;u&gt;inversion of control&lt;/u&gt; gives frameworks the power to serve as extensible skeletons. The methods supplied by the user tailor the generic algorithms defined in the framework for a particular application."</em> <br  />
 &ndash;Ralph Johnson and Brian Foote</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="srs_ao-power"></a>
Low Power Architecture</h2>
<p>Most modern embedded microcontrollers (MCUs) provide an assortment of low-power sleep modes designed to conserve power by gating the clock to the CPU and various peripherals. However, the sleep modes are entered under the software control and therefore require an appropriate software infrastructure.</p>
<p>An event-driven framework, like QP, based on inversion of control is particularly suitable for taking advantage of these power-savings features because the framework can easily detect situations in which the system has no more events to process, called the <em>idle condition</em>. In that case the framework can place the MCU into a low-power sleep mode <b>safely</b> and without creating race conditions with active interrupts.</p>

<td><b>Description</b><br  />
 The maximum capacity of an event queue is the maximum number of events that can be inside the queue at any given time. This maximum capacity shall be determined at run-time. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Use Case</b><br  />
 The event queue can be supplied with the buffer memory to hold the events at run-time. The size of that memory buffer will determine the maximum capacity of the event queue. </td></tr>

<th>QP Framework shall allow Active Object instances to be started at runtime </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Description</b><br  />
 Starting an Active Object instance means registering it with the QP Framework, so that the framework can start managing the Active Object. Only after an Active Object instance has been started, it can receive and process events. Starting at runtime means that Active Object instances can start at any time during the normal system operation (as opposed to starting only during system initialization). </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Use Case</b><br  />
 Starting an Active Object instance might involve initializing its event queue and creating and/or starting the execution context. Only after that, the underlying real-time kernel can include the Active Object in the scheduling process. </td></tr>

<th>QP Framework may allow Active Object instances to be stopped at runtime </th></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Description</b><br  />
 Stopping an Active Object instance means stopping its execution context and unregistering it from QP Framework. Stopping an Active Object does not mean that it is deleted, destroyed, or its memory is recycled. Stopping only means that the Active Object is no longer managed by QP Framework and stops participating in scheduling and event processing. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Background</b><br  />
 The biggest challenge in stopping an Active Object is to perform it <b>cleanly</b>, without disrupting the rest of the application. For example, the stopped Active Object should not receive any events from the rest of the application. Also, the Active Object should not have any events to process in its queue. For these reasons, stopping an Active Object is optional, and is <b>not recommended</b>, especially in safety-related applications. Instead of stopping an Active Object, a better design is to post a special event to that Active Object, which could trigger a transition to a special "stopped" state in the Active Object's state machine. </td></tr>

<th>Active Object abstraction may provide optional "operating-system object" for each Active Object instance </th></tr>

 The optional "operating system object" shall be compile-time configurable to allow various operating-system object types corresponding to the selected real-time kernel. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Use Case</b><br  />
 For example, the Active Object's event-queue for the POSIX operating system might require additional condition-variable attribute ("operating system object") to implement blocking on an empty queue. </td></tr>

 A good example of implementing such a policy is the concept of class encapsulation in OOP, where the internal attributes are accessible to the class operations (e.g., via the <code>this</code> pointer) and are harder to access from the outside. </td></tr>
