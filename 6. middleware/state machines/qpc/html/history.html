<li>modified examples for MPU (<code>examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl_mpu</code> and <code>examples/arm-cm/dpp_nucleo-c031c6_mpu</code>) to configure the MPU for the Idle thread, so that the QS-RX access is allowed.</li>
<li>added example for Cmake: <code>examples/posix-win32-cmake/dpp</code></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug Fixes:</b></p><ul>

</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_7_3_2"></a>
Version 7.3.2, 2023-12-13</h1>
<p>This maintenance release adds a minor design change to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm.html" title="Abstract State Machine class (state machine interface)">QAsm</a> base class and corrects a few issues discovered in QP/C 7.3.1.</p>
<p><b>QP/C source code:</b></p><ul>
<li>added "virtual" function <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm_vtable.html#af66bf360f1a489f50c502519cb80d264">QAsmVtable::isIn</a> to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm.html" title="Abstract State Machine class (state machine interface)">QAsm</a> base class (see <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm_vtable.html" title="Virtual table for the QAsm class.">QAsmVtable</a>)</li>
<li>added macro <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a9f21f71882bd92ecb905be8d828be2d5">QASM_IS_IN()</a> to "virtually" call the <code>isIn()</code> operation in the <em>subclasses</em> of <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm.html" title="Abstract State Machine class (state machine interface)">QAsm</a></li>
<li>added implementation of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html#aa25c7a0340e00f7f6b57bda846e4ce84">QHsm_isIn_()</a> virtual function to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> base class. In the process, fixed a bug in that implementation introduced by adding Duplicate Inverse Storage in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm.html#ad09463c93e0514cb2c82d7a1a8824e14">QAsm::temp</a> attribute.</li>
<li>added implementation of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html#a03c2bba938022e6e404cd077ed7ad748">QMsm_isIn_()</a> virtual function to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> base class</li>
<li>deprecated the <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a07a82a644aa2fdc946994db3e9e28974">QMsm_isInState()</a> function, which should be now replaced with <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a9f21f71882bd92ecb905be8d828be2d5">QASM_IS_IN()</a> "virtual" call</li>
<li>changed the semantics of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html#a370d8e5611750c588611cb48c3a7fc2a">QS_onFlush()</a> callback (software tracing), which is now NOT allowed to disable interrupts or use critical sections. This is necessary for avoiding nesting of QP critical sections, when <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html#a370d8e5611750c588611cb48c3a7fc2a">QS_onFlush()</a> is used inside <a class="el" href="qsafe_8h.html#ab4c1a6e8f1ba5f7f9855eb6f98f6209a">Q_onError()</a> handler (to trace the error).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ports:</b></p><ul>
<li>removed critical sections from the QS_onFlush() implementations in POSIX and Win32 ports (files <code>qs_port.c</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p><ul>
<li>removed interrupt disabling and critical sections from the <code>QS_onFlush()</code> implementations in all BSP files (<code>bsp.c</code>).</li>
<li>cleaned up the KEIL-uVision and IAR-EWARM project files that still contained old QP/C port header files (e.g., <code>qep_port.h</code>, <code>qf_port.h</code>, <code>qk_port.h</code>, <code>qv_port.h</code>, and <code>qxk_port.h</code>). These files (consolidated and renamed to <a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html" title="Sample QP/C port.">qp_port.h</a>) were not actually used to build the projects, but their presence was confusing.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_7_3_1"></a>
Version 7.3.1, 2023-12-05</h1>
<p>The focus of this release continues to be improving the support for <b>functional safety</b> standards. This release adds several mechanisms to the QP Functional Safety (FuSa) Subsystem to mitigate various potential hazards.</p>
<p><b>QP Functional Safety (FuSa) Subsystem:</b></p><ul>
<li>added assertions to critical sections in the QP/C (in ports to: ARM Cortex-M, POSIX, POSIX-QV, WIN32, and WIN32-QV) to ensure that:<ul>
<li>critical sections inside QP never nest</li>
<li>all QP critical sections are "balanced" meaning that every entry to a critical section is matched by exactly one exit from critical section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>added Duplicate Inverse Storage protection to all internal variables in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> kernels;</li>
<li>added explicit numerical loop limits for internal loops that traverse linked lists (e.g., time-event lists) or bitmasks (e.g., subscribers in pub-sub event delivery)</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> kernel:</b></p><ul>
<li>Added functions to disable/enable the non-preemptive <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> scheduler (<a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html#ada5c78a75ec73c4cd2e25c19ad124bb9">QV_schedDisable()</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html#ad0db4fd1a3a8a0e45388f86287ae5ccd">QV_schedEnable()</a>). These functions are intended for situations where a CPU-intensive AO does not wish to be activated until the scheduler is re-enabled (typically in the next clock tick). Such scheduling might improve the timeliness of higher-priority AOs.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ports:</b></p><ul>
<li>Redesigned the critical section implementation in ports to: ARM Cortex-M, POSIX, POSIX-QV, WIN32, and WIN32-QV to be based on functions rather than inline macros. This was needed to add the assertions mentioned above. (NOTE this redesign has NO impact on the applications)</li>
<li>Changed ports to POSIX (POSIX and POSIX-QV) to use only non-recursive mutex for critical sections. This is done after ensuring that the critical sections never nest, so the simple, fast and <em>portable</em> non-recursive mutex is sufficient.</li>
<li>Added templates of the QP configuration file (<code><a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html">qp_config.h</a></code>) to the ARM Cortex-M ports (in the <code>qpc/ports/arm-cm/&lt;qv|qk|qxk&gt;/config</code> directories.</li>
<li>Modified ports to 3rd-party RTOSes (embOS, FreeRTOS, ThreadX, uC-OS2, Zephyr) to allow setting the RTOS-native AO priority as the second parameter of the <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ac652bd9796be02f0e71af57b9a0b6a85">Q_PRIO()</a> macro.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p><ul>
<li>Added "real-time" example <code>qpc/examples/arm-cm/real-time_nucleo-l053r8</code> that demonstrates various scheduling policies of periodic and sporadic tasks. This includes multi-stage tasks and time-triggered scheduling under the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> kernel.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_7_3_0"></a>
Version 7.3.0, 2023-09-12</h1>
<p>The main focus of this QP/C release is improving the support for <b>functional safety</b> standards, such as IEC 61508 for electrical systems, and related IEC 62304/FDA510(k) for medical devices, IEC 60335 for household appliances, DO-178B/C for airborne systems.</p>
<p><b>QP Functional Safety (FuSa) Subsystem:</b> This release adds <a class="el" href="ssr_fusa.html">QP Functional Safety Subsystem</a>, which is an expansion of the assertion-based programming extensively used in the QP frameworks from the beginning. The <a class="el" href="ssr_fusa.html">QP FuSa Subsystem</a> consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software assertions as a recommended technique (called Failure Assertion Programming (FAP) in IEC 61508)</li>
<li>Software Self-Monitoring (SSM), which encompasses such techniques:<ul>
<li>Duplicate Inverse Storage for critical variables</li>
<li>Memory Markers for critical objects (e.g., events)</li>
<li><b>Memory Isolation by means of Memory Protection Unit (MPU)</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="el" href="cert.html">Certification Kit</a></p><ul>
<li>Expanded traceability and improved the use of <a class="el" href="cert.html#cert_uid">Unique Identifiers (UIDs)</a></li>
<li>Completed <a class="el" href="csc.html">MISRA-C:2023 Coding Standard Compliance</a> documentation</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Source Code:</b></p><ul>
<li>As part of transitioning to C99, changed all comments from C-style (/&lowast; &lowast;/) to C++ style (//). C++ style comments are now part of the C99 standard and are allowed in MISRA-C:2012/2023. This brings more commonality between QP/C and QP/C++.</li>
<li>Removed header file "qassert.h" and moved the assertions to the file "qsafe.h", which now is part of the QP Functional Safety (FuSa) Subsystem.</li>
<li>Renamed <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3aa0e957af9cc6386258fd0b173d38a6">Q_onAssert()</a> callback to <a class="el" href="qsafe_8h.html#ab4c1a6e8f1ba5f7f9855eb6f98f6209a">Q_onError()</a> and changed its semantics, which now involves a critical section (interrupts disabled). Specifically, the <a class="el" href="qsafe_8h.html#ab4c1a6e8f1ba5f7f9855eb6f98f6209a">Q_onError()</a> is always invoked inside a critical section.</li>
<li>Changed the macro for disabling the QP FuSa Subsystem from #Q_NASSERT to <a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#aaa7f7ef4f56fafa6755ec77e2122398a">Q_UNSAFE</a> (disabling QP FuSa Subsystem is <em>NOT</em> recommended, especially in safety-related projects).</li>
<li>Added the class <a class="el" href="struct_q_asm.html" title="Abstract State Machine class (state machine interface)">QAsm</a> (abstract state machine) as the abstract base class (ABC) for state machine implementations. This ABC removes the coupling between the QHsm-style and QMsm-style state machine implementation strategies.</li>
<li>Redesigned <a class="el" href="struct_q_evt.html" title="Event class.">QEvt</a> class to support RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for events, including dynamically allocated events</li>
<li>Added a Memory Marker to all events (in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_evt.html#a6995c25983eaf7f37e33024cff480d4e">QEvt.evtTag_</a> attribute).</li>
<li>Added a <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ac7226b5503165a28e8790579af9a3fb7">QEVT_INITIALIZER()</a> macro for initialization of immutable (const) events and encapsulate the Memory Marker.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="struct_q_evt.html" title="Event class.">QEvt</a> constructor for dynamic events (enabled by macro <a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#af75f8572e884087d0433f777f3cf5e50">QEVT_DYN_CTOR</a>).</li>
<li>Modified macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a85513d80fc73d015efff2596428e4703">Q_NEW()</a> and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a9da2c27f98ee35a75caeec5710bafb8a">Q_NEW_X()</a> for the case when macro <a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#af75f8572e884087d0433f777f3cf5e50">QEVT_DYN_CTOR</a> is defined</li>
<li>Re-designed the internals of the framework for Memory Isolation by dynamically adjusting memory settings (e.g., by dynamically reconfiguring the MPU). Among others, this required removing virtual functions for posting events from the <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> base class.</li>
<li>Modified QP/C source code for better compliance with MISRA-C:2023.</li>
<li>Added traceability links to the MISRA-C deviations in source code comments.</li>
<li>Modified the behavior of <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_semaphore.html" title="Counting Semaphore of the QXK preemptive kernel.">QXSemaphore</a> in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel, which now behaves like semaphore in embOS/uC-OS2 rather then a semaphore in FreeRTOS.</li>
<li>Added Duplicate Inverse Storage to the memory pools (<a class="el" href="struct_q_m_pool.html" title="Native QF Memory Pool.">QMPool</a>). Specifically, all the pointers in the link-list of the free blocks in the pool are now guarded with Duplicate Inverse Storage. This doubles the minimum size of the free block from one to <em>two</em> pointers.</li>
<li>Added Duplicate Inverse Storage to the subscriber lists (<a class="el" href="struct_q_subscr_list.html" title="Subscriber List (for publish-subscribe)">QSubscrList</a>). This doubles the size of the size of <a class="el" href="struct_q_subscr_list.html" title="Subscriber List (for publish-subscribe)">QSubscrList</a>.</li>
<li>Added Duplicate Inverse Storage to the ready-sets of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernels.</li>
<li>Introduced new macros for Memory Isolation:<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#ad6f2c2da932b406c8031ec31d128f0dd">QF_MEM_ISOLATE</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#aa914cbfc80c44e515eb46f1ce4a7df77">QF_MEM_SYS()</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a34e2e815e355bf098b93d9e6847a3900">QF_MEM_APP()</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ports:</b></p><ul>
<li>Redesigned and simplified the port structure. Consolidated multiple include files (e.g., qep_port.h, qk_port.h, etc.) with <a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html" title="Sample QP/C port.">qp_port.h</a>. This reduced the number of header include file levels from 5 to 3.</li>
<li>Added optional QP configuration file <code><a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html">qp_config.h</a></code>, which can be used for compile-time configuration of the QP/C framework for specific application without changing the official port.

</li>
<li>Modified the ARM Cortex-M ports (<code>qpc/ports/arm-cm</code>) to support Memory Isolation by means of the MPU (configurable by the macros <a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#ad6f2c2da932b406c8031ec31d128f0dd">QF_MEM_ISOLATE</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#aa914cbfc80c44e515eb46f1ce4a7df77">QF_MEM_SYS()</a>, and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a34e2e815e355bf098b93d9e6847a3900">QF_MEM_APP()</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p><ul>
<li>Re-designed the sample application code and QM models (for Blinky, DPP, etc.) to present a new "modern" way of structuring and organizing QP/C applications.</li>
<li>Modified the BSPs (Board Support Packages) in examples (mostly for ARM Cortex-M) to define the function <code>assert_failed()</code>, which is now consistently called by fault handlers in the startup code.</li>
<li>Added new examples for the affordable STM32C0 MCUs:<ul>
<li><code>qpcpp/examples/arm-cm/dpp_nucleo-c031c6</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new examples for Memory Isolation with the MPU:<ul>
<li><code>qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_nucleo-c031c6_mpu</code> - use of MPU in ARM Cortex-M0+</li>
<li><code>qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl_mpu</code> - use of MPU in ARM Cortex-M4F</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed calls to <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3aa0e957af9cc6386258fd0b173d38a6">Q_onAssert()</a> from all example startup code and replaced it with calls to <code>assert_failed()</code>. This is for consistency and interoperability with existing libraries (e.g., STM32Cube) and for adding flexibility in defining error handling for <em>hardware</em> exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This change impacts most existing examples because it is now necessary to define <code>assert_failed()</code> in the applications (typically in the Board Support Package). The typical definition of <code>assert_failed()</code> is to call <a class="el" href="qsafe_8h.html#ab4c1a6e8f1ba5f7f9855eb6f98f6209a">Q_onError()</a>.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Documentation:</b></p><ul>
<li>Reorganized the QP/C documentation according to the new Documentation Management Plan.</li>
<li>Removed the Doxygen documentation from the source code and placed it in the separate directory <code>qpc/doc</code>. This separation of concerns significantly reduces the need to change (and re-certify!) the QP/C source code just to update the documentation. This is part of the new Configuration Management Plan.</li>

Version 7.0.1, 2022-07-31</h1>
<p>This release is the first one that contains the complete <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm">QM model</a> of the QP/C framework (in the file <code>qpc/qpc.qm</code>). This model is then used to <b>generate all QP/C source code</b>:</p><ul>
<li><code>qpc/</code><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="dir_9b55b230f41344f00f9f1f35be51edc6.html">include</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="dir_28a04cc6444cdd1b436423abf3214ac3.html">src</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The QM model of QP/C explicitly captures the <em>logical design</em> of the framework, which is then mapped to the preexisting <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qm/ce.html#ce_phys">physical design</a>. The <em>logical design</em>, which consists of packages (some associated with namespaces), classes, types, and macros traces explicitly to the <a class="el" href="sas.html">Software Architecture Specification (SAS)</a> and is easier to manipulate and refactor.</p>
<p><b>Source Code Changes:</b></p><ul>
<li>The whole QP/C source code is now generated from the <code>qpc.qm</code> model.</li>
<li>Refactored classes with only static members (<a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a>) into "namespaces".</li>

<ul>
<li>Moved package-scope header files qf_pkg.h and <a class="el" href="qs__pkg_8h.html" title="QS/C package-scope interface.">qs_pkg.h</a> from the <code>qpc/src</code> directory to <code>qpc/include</code>. This allows the build process to specify only the <code>qpc/include</code> directory to build applications and QP/C source code. Previously, the build process had to specify additionally <code>qpc/src</code>, but this is no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This change allowed all provided examples to be simplified by removing the <code>qpc/src</code> include directory from the various project files.</dd></dl>

Version 6.9.3, 2021-04-12</h1>
<p><b>Feature Requests:</b></p><ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/191">feature#191 "Add QS local filtering to QF_PUBLISH()"</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature has been implemented by means of the "sender" parameter of the <code><a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#afd57334f2a1664a168b0702a106e0782">QF_PUBLISH()</a></code> macro, which must now be a pointer to a struct that has the <code>prio</code> member. This design enables applying <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> local filter to the <code>prio</code> as the QS-Id. This works for publishing events from active objects. For publishing events outside active objects (e.g., from ISRs), the header file <code><a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a></code> provides a type <code><a class="el" href="struct_q_spy_id.html" title="QS ID type for applying local filtering.">QSpyId</a></code>, which should be used to define <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> ID variables to be used as "sender" in <code><a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#afd57334f2a1664a168b0702a106e0782">QF_PUBLISH()</a></code>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This change only affects the Spy build configuration, where the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing instrumentation is enabled. The existing code could require modifications to provide "sender" pointer that can access <code>prio</code> directly. For example, AOs would need to call <code>QF_PUBLISH(e, &amp;me-&gt;super)</code> instead of <code><a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#afd57334f2a1664a168b0702a106e0782">QF_PUBLISH(e, me)</a></code>.</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/185">feature#185 "Add possibility of assigning name to AO threads in QP-RTOS ports"</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This feature request is now implemented uniformly in all QP-ports to 3rd-party RTOSes by means of the generic QP API QActive_setAttr(). Specifically, the QP port will allow you to set the thread name by calling QActive_setAttr() before calling <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a4cdbac20a04929fedd879615f0ddda00">QACTIVE_START()</a>.</p>

Version 6.9.2, 2021-01-18</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is a redesign of the QS-RX (software tracing input) to implement the feature request #187:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/187">feature#187 "Make the byte order in QS-RX buffer compatible with DMA"</a></li>

Version 6.9.1, 2020-09-28</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is a redesign of the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html#qs_local"><b>QS Local Filter</b></a> (see also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/127">feature request #127</a>). This new design supports filtering on <b>multiple</b> active objects (as well as other objects in the Target memory), as opposed to filtering just one such object at a time. The main use case for this redesign of <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> Local Filter is an application, where some active objects are very "noisy", and would overwhelm your trace. The new <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> Local Filter allows you to selectively silence the "noisy" active objects and let all the others through.</p>
<p>The new <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> Local Filter is based on "QS-IDs" associated with various objects in the Target memory. The QS-IDs are small integer numbers, such as the unique priorities assigned to QP Active Objects, but there are more such QS-IDs, which you can assign to various other objects through the macro <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a7de8258de47e0e1bab1a6e0d93412973">QS_BEGIN_ID()</a>. Then, you can setup the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> Local Filter to trace only a specific QS-IDs or whole groups of QS-IDs by means of the macro <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a1dda63ebde1afe3a72a680731d2981c2">QS_LOC_FILTER()</a> or remotely via the QS-RX channel.</p>
<p><b>Source code changes:</b></p>
<p>The redesign of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> Local Filter impacts the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace instrumentation in QP/C: both the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html#qs_pre"><b>pre-defined QS trace records</b></a> and the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html#qs_app"><b>application-specific trace records</b></a>. The changes to the pre-defined records are confided to the QP/C source code and are transparent to the application developers. However, the changes to the application-specific trace records require adjusting existing applications as follows:</p>

Version 6.9.0, 2020-08-21</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to adjust the QP/C RTEF to the changes and improvements introduced in <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/history.html">QTools 6.9.0</a>. Specifically, QP/C now includes examples for the new <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qview.html">QView Visualization &amp; Monitoring</a> as well as adjustments for the new version of <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html">QUTest Unit Testing</a>.</p>
<p><b>Source code changes:</b></p>
<p>Added new <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a0f0e239627aea4a7387f03c6e5178584" title="QF_run() was entered.">QS_QF_RUN</a> trace record to <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html">QS software tracing</a>, which is now generated in all QP/C ports upon the entry to <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html#a779a1bc9482e2d489dc87751cd100fdb">QF_run()</a>. This trace record marks the end of the application startup, at which time all the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html#qs_dict">QS dictionaries</a> are typically produced.</p>
<p>Also, added the information about the target <b>endianness</b> to the <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a6a73ed1da89600585ca91b5572941ea4" title="reports the Target information">QS_TARGET_INFO</a> <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace record.</p>

<p><b>Updated Ports:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>All QP/C ports to 3rd-party RTOSes (embOS, FreeRTOS, ThreadX, uC/OS-II) and OSes (POSIX, POSIX-QV, WIN32, WIN32-QV) have been updated to generate the <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a0f0e239627aea4a7387f03c6e5178584" title="QF_run() was entered.">QS_QF_RUN</a> trace record.</li>
<li>The POSIX and POSIX-QV ports have been updated to add the call to <code>pthread_attr_setinheritsched(&amp;attr, PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED)</code> (see also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/276">bug#276</a>)</li>
<li>The MSP430 ports have been extended for the GNU-MSP430 compiler, so that they now work with IAR-MSP40, TI-MSP40 and GNU-MSP430 toolchains.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Updated Examples:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>All <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html">QUTest</a> examples (<code>qpc\examples\qutest</code> directory) have been modified to use the new location of the <code>qutest.py</code> Python module.

<p>Also, this release updates the QP/C ports and examples for workstations (Windows and POSIX) by consistently applying the "safe" versions of services from <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>. The "portable" versions of these services are defined as macros in the <code>safe_std.h</code> header file and include the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MEMMOVE_S()</code> -&gt; <code>memmove_s()</code></li>
<li><code>STRCPY_S()</code> -&gt; <code>strcpy_s()</code></li>
<li><code>STRCPY_S()</code> -&gt; <code>strcpy_s()</code></li>
<li><code>STRCAT_S()</code> -&gt; <code>strcat_s()</code></li>
<li><code>SNPRINTF_S()</code> -&gt; <code>_snprintf_s()</code></li>
<li><code>PRINTF_S()</code> -&gt; <code>printf_s()</code></li>
<li><code>FPRINTF_S()</code> -&gt;<code>fprintf_s()</code></li>

<li><code>FOPEN_S()</code> -&gt; <code>fopen_s()</code></li>
<li><code>LOCALTIME_S()</code> -&gt; <code>localtime_s()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These "safe" functions are mapped to the best approximation of these services available on a given platform. For example, <code>STRCPY_S()</code> is mapped to <code>strcpy_s()</code> on Windows and <code>strcpy()</code> on POSIX (Linux/MacOS/etc.).</p>

<li>Introduced <a class="el" href="qsafe_8h.html#a3c9a47863f0f4254858b3387335869cb">Q_NORETURN</a> macro for <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3aa0e957af9cc6386258fd0b173d38a6">Q_onAssert()</a>, which can (if defined) inform the compiler that <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3aa0e957af9cc6386258fd0b173d38a6">Q_onAssert()</a> does not return. This can potentially improve the code generation and can improve diagnostics generated by the compiler as well as static code analysis tools.</li>
<li>Moved many qs facilities for internal use (only inside the QP/C source code) from <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a> to <a class="el" href="qs__pkg_8h.html" title="QS/C package-scope interface.">qs_pkg.h</a>. These are mostly facilities related to internal <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> implementation as well as pre-defined <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace records, which are only used inside QP and are not needed in the QP applications.</li>
<li>Removed all pre-conditions from QActiveDummy_start_() function in <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html">qutest.c</a>. This is to allow starting dummy AOs the exact same way as the real counterparts (e.g., with stack storage, which <a class="el" href="struct_q_active_dummy.html" title="Dummy Active Object for testing.">QActiveDummy</a> does not really need).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Updated 3rd-Party Components:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>FreeRTOS from 10.2.1 to 10.3.0</li>
<li>SEGGER embOS from 4.34.1 to 5.06.1</li>
<li>SEGGER emWin from 5.32 to 6.10</li>
<li>Removed TI-RTOS (both port and examples)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Updated Examples:</b></p>
<p>Converted most of the examples for ARM-MDK from the no-longer maintained compiler-5 (RVDS) to the new ARM Compiler-6 (ARM-clang). The examples for ARM Compiler-6 are located in the <code>armclang</code> sub-directories.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The older ARM Compiler-5 is still supported, but will be phased out in the future. The only examples for ARM Compiler-5 are for the EK-TM4C123GXL (TivaC LanuchPad) board. These examples are located in the <code>arm</code> sub-directories.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_7_0"></a>
Version 6.7.0, 2019-12-30</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is providing improved compliance with MISRA-C:2012 (including MISRA-C:2012-Amendment-1) and also to provide support for the <a href="https://www.gimpel.com"><b>PC-Lint-Plus</b></a> static analysis tool (see also feature request <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/169">#169</a>). Specifically, the QP/C source code and some examples have been adjusted to comply with MISRA-C:2012-Amendment-1 rules, with all deviations captured in the PC-Lint-Plus configuration files. These PC-Lint-Plus configuration files have been provided in the new "port" to PC-Lint-Plus in the directory qpc/ports/lint-plus/.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The support for the older PC-Lint 9.x and the older MISRA-C:2004 has been dropped to avoid confusion and conflicts with the newer MISRA-C:2012 and the newer PC-Lint-Plus.</dd></dl>
<p>This release also includes the offline documentation for <b>this</b> particular version of QP/C (in the <code>html/</code> folder). To view the offline documentation, open the file <code>html/index.html</code> in your web browser. (The online HTML documentation for the <b>latest</b> version of QP/C remains located at: <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/">https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/</a> )</p>
<p>The backwards-compatiblity layer for QP 4.x has been removed. Among others, the macros Q_ROM and Q_ROM_VAR are no longer defined.</p>
<p>Also, this release updates the Windows-GUI examples with the QWIN Prototyping Toolkit to work with the latest Visual Studio 2019 and specifically with the Resource Editor now available. Specifically here, the Game-GUI example (<code>qpc\examples\arm-cm\game_efm32-slstk3401a\win32-gui</code>) and the DPP-GUI example (<code>qpc\examples\arm-cm\dpp_efm32-slstk3401a\win32-gui</code>) have been updated to build with the Visual Studio 2019.</p>

Version 6.6.0, 2019-10-31</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is the change in distribution of the QP/C framework, which is now bundled together with the other QP frameworks (QP/C++ and QP-nano) as well as QM, and the QTools collection into "QP-bundle". This "QP-bundle" provides a single, streamlined and simplified download and installation of all QP frameworks and all the accompanying tools.</p>
<p>This release brings also the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed "//" (double slash) from all comments for compliance with the MISRA-C:2012 required Rule 3.1. (The "//" sequence was used in the URLs, such as "http://~~~").</li>
<li>converted inclusion guards in header files to uppercase as per coding convention for macros.</li>
<li>replaced "vtbl" with "vtable" in QP/C source code</li>
<li>changed the type of the last parameter in QHsm_init_() and <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a165b92dae17dfe7975216087b7bc503c">QHSM_INIT()</a> from "QEvt const *" to "void const *" to allow passing arbitrary data during initialization.</li>
<li>increased <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a48cec974671d01f280b2b1a33225d176" title="the first record available to QS users">QS_USER</a> from 70 to 100 and made the freed-up records reserved</li>
<li>changed the QS_Ux_RECORDS groups to partition user trace records 100-124 into 5 groups of 5 records each.</li>
<li>removed Tcl test scripts from QUTest examples</li>
</ul>

Version 6.5.1, 2019-05-24</h1>
<p><b>Bug Fixes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/241">bug#241 "QUTest produces superfluous Trg-Done QS_RX_EVENT after publish"</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/242">bug#242 "QUTest fails to process events posted/published from user commands"</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this release extends the <code>Makefiles</code> in the <code>qpc\examples\qutest</code> directory to provide the <code>debug</code> target. Specificall, the <code>qpc\examples\qutest\blinky</code> example has been extended with projects to <code>build/debug</code> this example with Visual C++ (on the host) and with ARM-KEIL on embedded target (EK-TM4C123).</p>
<p>Finally, this release adds ports and examples for PIC24/dsPIC 16-bit MCUs with MPLAB-X/XC16 and PIC32 with MPLAB-X/XC32 toolchains.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_5_0"></a>
Version 6.5.0, 2019-03-30</h1>
<p>This QP/C release matches the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qm/history.html#qm_4_5_0">QM release 4.5.0</a>, which introduced new implementation for QP/C++. Even though this has no impact on the QP/C state machine implementation with QM, this release is needed for compatibility checking between QP and QM.</p>
<p>For commonality with the new QP/C++ implementation, this release adds macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#aeb993294cc885215f15c5d1238e8d392">Q_ACTION_NULL</a> and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#abc3b399c7545e18255f8e57f3f60fbf9">QM_STATE_NULL</a>, which are used in the code generated from QM 4.5.0. Also, this release comes with several models for <b>QM 4.5.0</b>.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release changes the API QTimeEvt_ctr() to QTimeEvt_currCtr(). This is to avoid name shadowing with the <code>ctr</code> variables, which is not compliant with MISRA.</p>
<p>Additionally, the examples for <code>calc1</code> and <code>calc1_sub</code> (with QM 4.5.0 models) have been extended to properly handle the operator precedence (multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction).</p>

Version 6.4.0, 2019-02-10</h1>
<p>This release brings the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed QActive_stop()</li>
<li>added assertions to <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a165b92dae17dfe7975216087b7bc503c">QHSM_INIT()</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a4cdbac20a04929fedd879615f0ddda00">QACTIVE_START()</a> and <a class="el" href="qxk_8h.html#aab6a4fe65f8febf1bab4b619fc861e7e">QXTHREAD_START()</a> to make sure the the virtual-pinter (vptr) is initialized</li>

</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_8"></a>
Version 6.3.8, 2018-12-31</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is the update the <code>Makefiles</code> that use the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm">GNU-ARM Embedded Toolchain</a> to match the recent update in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/QTools">QTools for Windows 6.3.8</a>. Specifically, all <code>Makefiles</code> in the <code>examples</code> directory have been updated to use the GNU-ARM toolchain located in <code>qtools\gnu_arm-none-eabi</code> and use the tools prefix <b>arm-none-eabi-</b>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The <code>Makefiles</code> that use the GNU-ARM included in this release require <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/QTools">QTools for Windows version 6.3.8 or newer</a> and will <b>NOT</b> work with the older QTools collection.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_7"></a>
Version 6.3.7, 2018-11-20</h1>
<p>The main goal of this release is to provide Python test scripts that match the newly re-designed Python support for the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html">QUTest unit testing harness</a> (see QTools <b>6.3.7</b>). Specifically, the Python tests scripts (*.py files) in the <code>qpc/examples/qutest</code> directory) have been all upgraded to the new syntax and format. Also, all the makefiles in that directory have been modified to execute Python test scripts by default, and Tcl test scripts only when the argument <code>SCRIPTS=tcl</code> is specified.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The new scripting interface <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest_script.html">qutest.py</a> is now the primary supported QUTest scripting interface. The older interfaces, such as TCL ("qutest.tcl") and "qspypy" are considered <em>obsolete</em> and are <b>not recommended</b> for writing new test scripts.</dd></dl>
<p>The second change in this release is updating the QP ports to Win32 and POSIX to eliminate the obsolete function <code>gethostbyname()</code> and replacing it with <code>getaddrinfo()</code>. This change has ripple effects on Windows, because it requires linking with "ws2_32" library, instead of "wsock2". All affected <code>Makefiles</code> in the <code>qpc\examples\</code> directory have been updated to link the newer "ws2_32" library.</p>
<p>Also, in this release, the prototypes of the internal functions <code>QActive_start_()</code>, <code>QActive_get_()</code>, <code>QActive_post_()</code> and <code>QActive_postLIFO_()</code> have been removed from the public <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> interface (in qf.h) and moved to the QF-implementation. This is to prevent calling these internal functions directly in the application-level code. The only allowed use of these functions is through the macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a4cdbac20a04929fedd879615f0ddda00">QACTIVE_START()</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ab7c56990d949c8708e3fe2b737f2e65c">QACTIVE_POST()</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a766856b24aa5163b7ca90bc3432f1e3e">QACTIVE_POST_X()</a> and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a2f94b69fa7148180c19d501ce2ee7032">QACTIVE_POST_LIFO()</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this release updates the internal implementation of <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> function <code>QXThread_post_()</code> for software tracing and testing with QUTest.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_6"></a>
Version 6.3.6, 2018-10-20</h1>
<p>This release brings important changes and improvements to the unit-testing support for <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html">QUTest</a>. Specifically, a new "dummy" active object class <a class="el" href="struct_q_active_dummy.html" title="Dummy Active Object for testing.">QActiveDummy</a> for testing has been added. Instances of this "dummy" AO can be now used as test-doubles for active objects that are recipients of events directly posted by the active object under test (AOUT). This, in turn, eliminates the need to alter the existing event-posting implementation, so that more of the actual QP code can be used in the QP test-stub (<a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html">qutest.c</a>).</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The QUTest projects that build QP from sources need to include the <a class="el" href="qf__time_8c.html">qf_time.c</a> file.</dd></dl>
<p>As a consequence of the changes in the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html">QUTest</a> support, the <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_qutest">QUTest examples</a> have been re-designed and improved. Here, the most important changes include the new code organization, which reflects the customary separation of the code-under-test (CUT) from the code for testing. Also, the tests based on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435662X">"TDD book" by James Grenning</a> have been replaced with fully functional tests based on the <a href="http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity">Unity testing framework</a>. This is to directly compare the traditional approach (Unity) with QUTest.</p>
<p>The next change related to unit testing is adding ::QS_RX_QUERY_CURR facility to QS-RX (software tracing input channel) and the reply <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#ad6bf3f7eceb7c0b063082d25f22ee994" title="reports the data from &quot;current object&quot; query">QS_QUERY_DATA</a> to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> output channel. These two extensions allow you to query the status of the "current object" inside the target. The most important example is querying the current state-machine object (<a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a3ee4a3be50e7ffe79821a8c015afaff7" title="state machine object">SM_OBJ</a>), which returns the <b>current state</b>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The new "query" facilities in QP/C match the latest additions to the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qspy.html">QSPY host application</a>.</dd></dl>
<p>Also this release adds <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html#qs_dict">QS dictionary</a> generation for all registered event pools. The generated object dictionaries are <code>EvtPool1</code> for pool-1, <code>EvtPool2</code> for pool-2, etc.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Applications no longer need to generate <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> object dictionaries for the event pool storage buffers, such as <code>smlPoolSto[]</code>, etc.</dd></dl>
<p>Another big change in this release is re-designing of the <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_gpos">examples for workstations</a> (previously <code>win32</code>, <code>win32-qv</code>, <code>posix</code> and <code>posix-qv</code>). All these types of examples have been consolidated in the <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_gpos">exampes/workstation</a> folder, where the provided <code>Makefiles</code> have been extended to be cross-platform so that they work on Windows, Linux, and MacOS without changes.</p>
<p>To facilitate the creation of truly portable, cross-platform examples, the existing <a class="el" href="ports_gpos.html">QP ports to Windows/POSIX</a> have been augmented with abstractions for portable console access. Also, the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qs.html">QS software tracing</a> support via TCP/IP has been now added to the ports themselves. This means that applications no longer need to repeat the code for <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> callbacks in the BSP implementation.</p>
<p>Finally, this release fixes a bug in the <a class="el" href="posix-qv.html">POSIX-QV port</a>, where the internal condition variable <code>QV_condVar_</code> has not been initialized.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_4"></a>
Version 6.3.4, 2018-08-10</h1>
<p>This release adds new API QTimeEvt_wasDisarmed() for checking the status of a <a class="el" href="struct_q_time_evt.html" title="Time Event class.">QTimeEvt</a> object after it has been disarmed. Specifically, the status of the last call to QTimeEvt_disarm() is kept inside the time event object and can be subsequently checked with the QTimeEvt_wasDisarmed() API. This new function is designed to be used directly as a guard condition on the timeout event, as described in the <a href="/psicc2">PSiCC2 book</a>, Section 7.7.3 "Arming and Disarming a Time Event" on page 359. The QTimeEvt_wasDisarmed() has a side effect of setting the "was disabled" status, so the guard evaluates to 'true' the next time it is checked.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_3a"></a>
Version 6.3.3a, 2018-07-16</h1>
<p>This release adds Python test scripts to the QUTest examples (folder <code>qpc/examples/qutest</code>). Specifically, the makefiles have been augmented to accept symbol <code>SCRIPT=py</code>, in which case the Python test scripts (<code>*.py</code>) are used instead of the default Tcl test scripts (<code>*.tcl</code>).</p>
<dl class="section remark"><dt>Remarks</dt><dd>This release does not change any QP/C APIs, QP/C implementation, ports, or other examples.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_3"></a>
Version 6.3.3, 2018-06-22</h1>
<p>This release fixes the following bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/216">bug#216 "Generated code for QP version check violates MISRA-C Rule 10.1"</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/217">bug#217 "GNU-ARM -fstack-protector incompatible with the QP ports to GNU-ARM"</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this release demonstrates the new features of QM 4.3.0 in several example models (qpc/examples/ directory).</p>
<p>Finally, this release updates <code>3rd_party/CMSIS/Include</code> to the latest version from GitHub.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_3_2"></a>
Version 6.3.2, 2018-06-20</h1>
<p>This release fixes the following bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/215">bug#215 "QP is internally inconsistent in calling assertion macros"</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this release improves the QUTest DPP example (directory <code>qpc/examples/qutest/dpp</code>) by demonstrating the proper use of <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#ae5841714b4f420c33df0a5132cc3f2c7">QS_TEST_PAUSE()</a> and the corresponding test scripts. This example now matches the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest_rtc.html#qutest_pause">QUTest documentation of this feature</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this release modifies the QP/C ports to POSIX and POSIX-QV by allowing to configure the p-thread priority of the ticker thread. This is achieved by adding a <code>tickPrio</code> parameter to the <code>QF_setTickRate()</code> function. (<b>NOTE</b> this modification will require changing existing QP applications for POSIX or POSIX-QV that call <code>QF_setTickRate()</code>.</p>

To implement this new feature, the QS-RX (<a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> receive channel) has been extended by a small scheduler that processes all secondary events gnenerated by dispatching, posting, or publishing events (only active when the #Q_UTEST macro is defined). Also, the implementation of the target resident QUTest components (files <code><a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html">src/qs/qutest.c</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="qf__actq_8c.html">src/qf/qf_actq.c</a></code>) have been modified to allow posting of events during unit testing.</p>
<p>Additionally, the release adds standard <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace records (the <code><a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a></code> header file) for event deferring and recalling (<a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a9cb7bde5f9a6515f7c26ba07e3cd68cc" title="AO deferred an event.">QS_QF_ACTIVE_DEFER</a> and <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a1198b3e69f04119875431eda396d38f5" title="AO recalled an event.">QS_QF_ACTIVE_RECALL</a>) as well as recall-attempt (<a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a65da04cff745a01de7661006869d2792" title="AO attempted to recall an event.">QS_QF_ACTIVE_RECALL_ATTEMPT</a>). Also standard <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace records have been added for creating/deleting new event references (<a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#ab2a5b85bda9829cfa535774c1676bae2" title="new event reference was created">QS_QF_NEW_REF</a> and <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#a118fac26bfea59e3184df6d11cc31fe6" title="an event reference is about to be deleted">QS_QF_DELETE_REF</a>, respectively). To make room for these new records, the following rarely-used records have been removed: QS_QF_ACTIVE_ADD, QS_QF_ACTIVE_REMOVE, QS_QF_EQUEUE_INIT, and QS_QF_MPOOL_INIT. The global filter settings in the QS_filterOn() and QS_filterOff() functions have been updated to the re-organized <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace records.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Because of the changes in the standard <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace recods, this release requires the matching <b>QSPY 6.2.0</b> or later. Also, because of the changes this release might break some existing QUTest unit test scripts, which need to be re-adjusted to the new trace records.</dd></dl>
<p>Additionally, this release improves support for tracing and unit-testing embedded POSIX targets, such as embedded Linux, or OSes/RTOSes with the POSIX compatibility layer. Specifically, the POSIX ports (<code>qpc/ports/posix/</code> and <code>qpc/ports/posix-qutest/</code>) no longer produce libraries. Instead all examples for POSIX (<code>qpc/examples/posix/</code> and <code>qpc/examples/qutest</code>) build the QP/C framework directly from the sources, which promotes consisentcy in the toolchain and options used. For unit testing, the makefiles <code>posix.mak</code> have been added for projects <code>qpc/examples/qutest/dpp/</code> and <code>qpc/examples/qutest/self_test/</code>. These makefiles support remote unit testing of embedded POSIX targets over TCP/IP, where the POSIX target runs only the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html#qutest_struct">test fixture</a>, but the host (e.g., Windows host) executes both the QSPY host application and runs the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html#qutest_struct">QUTest scripts</a>. The previous makefiles for POSIX have been renamed to <code>posix_host.mak</code>, because they are intended to use POSIX as a <em>host</em>, as opposed to a <em>target</em>.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds new QUTest exampes, which illustrate:</p><ul>
<li>event deferral (<code>qpc/examples/qutest/defer/</code>)</li>
<li>dispatching/posting events with parameters (<code>qpc/examples/qutest/evt_par/</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this release updates the QP/C ports to win32-qv and posix-qv to allow a "tickless" mode, where the "tickerThread" is not created. This mode is set by configuring the system clock tick rate to 0 (QF_setTickRate(0)).</p>
<p>Finally, this release phases out the <code><a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html" title="Sample QP/C port.">qp_port.h</a></code> header file. If any of your projects still includes this file, please replace it with the <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html" title="QP/C interface including the backwards-compatibility layer.">qpc.h</a> header file.</p>

Version 6.1.1, 2018-02-18</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is adding the context-switch callbacks to the preemptive <a class="el" href="srs_qk.html">QK</a> and <a class="el" href="srs_qxk.html">QXK</a> kernels. The QK_onContextSw() and QXK_onContextSw() callback functions provide a mechanism to perform additional custom operations when QK/QXK switches context from one thread to another. To avoid extra overhead when this functionality is not needed and for backwards-compatiblity with the existing applications, the callbacks are enabled only when the macros #QK_ON_CONTEXT_SW (for <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>) and #QXK_ON_CONTEXT_SW (for <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>) are defined. These macros can be defined either directly in command-line for the compiler, or in the QK/QXK port files (qk_port.c for <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> and qxk_port.c for <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>). Examples for the context-switch callbacks have been provided for for the NUCLEO-L053R8 (Cortex-M0+) and the NUCLEO-H743ZI (Cortex-M7).</p>
<p>Also, this release changes the ARM Cortex-M ports for the IAR-ARM toolchain in that it replaces the assembly modules with the equivalent C implementation. This change enables using the configuration macros #QK_ON_CONTEXT_SW (for <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>) and #QXK_ON_CONTEXT_SW (for <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>) in the ports. All existing example projects for IAR-ARM have been updated to use the <code>q(x)k_port.c</code> files instead of <code>q(x)k_port.s</code> files.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds new project files for the Atollic TRUEstudio for STM32. The TRUEstudio projects (Eclipse) have been added for the NUCLEO-L053R8 (Cortex-M0+) and the NUCLEO-H743ZI (Cortex-M7).</p>
<p>Finally, this release updates the CMSIS to version 5.3.0 (see <code>qpc/3rd_party/CMSIS</code>)</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_1_0"></a>
Version 6.1.0, 2018-02-04</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is adding the support for the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler"><b>ARM Compiler 6 (ARM-Clang)</b></a>, which is a C/C++ toolchain for ARM processors based on the modern <a href="https://clang.llvm.org">Clang frontend</a> and the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM framework</a>. This release adds the ARM-Clang ports and examples for all built-in kernels (<a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>) for the ARM Cortex-M CPU cores.</p>
<p>This release also adds support for the STM32H7 high-performance Cortex-M7 with the <b>double-precision FPU</b> (FPv5-DP-D16-M). Specifically, this release provides examples for the <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-h743zi.html">NUCLEO-H743ZI board</a> (Cortex-M7 with FPv5-DP-D16-M). The examples for NUCLEO-H743ZI board include all built-in kernels with ARM-CLANG, ARM-KEIL, GNU-ARM, and IAR-ARM. Additionally the NUCLEO-H743ZI examples also include the QP FreeRTOS with ARM-KEIL, GNU-ARM, and IAR-ARM.</p>
<p>Also, this release changes the ARM Cortex-M ports for the GNU-ARM toolchain in that it replaces the assembly modules with the equivalent C implementation. This change enables using wider range of GNU-ARM toolchain distributions, such as GNU-ARM Linaro, which had trouble with the assembly modules, but compiles correctly the C modules. All related GNU-ARM example projects have been modified to use the new C-ports.</p>
<p>Also, this release updates the existing projects for the Code Composer Studio (CCS) to CCSv7. All existing CCS projects for the EK-TM4C123GXL (TivaC LauchPad) and LaunchXL2-TMS57012 (Hercules) boards have been upgraded and tested.</p>
<p>Also, all examples for MSP430 with CCS have been updated to CCSv7 and re-tested on the supported boards.</p>

Version 6.0.4, 2018-01-10</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is the provision of the official <a class="el" href="freertos.html">QP/C port to FreeRTOS</a> (version 10). The QP/C port to FreeRTOS is completely generic and should work on any CPU supported by FreeRTOS. The port comes with the following examples (see examples/freertos):</p><ul>
<li>DPP on EK-TM4C123GXL (ARM Cortex-M4F) with ARM-KEIL, GNU-ARM and IAR-ARM toolchains.</li>
<li>DPP on STM32F746G-Discovery (ARM Cortex-M7) with ARM-KEIL, GNU-ARM and IAR-ARM toolchains.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release also replaces assembly with C implementation in the ARM-KEIL ports or the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernels to Cortex-M to take advantage of the <code>__asm</code> functions. (NOTE: this change has impact on the existing QP/C applications that use the ARM-KEIL toolchain and the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> or <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernels.)</p>
<p>Additionally, this release fixes some problems with the native examples for STM32F4 and STM32F7 boards.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release adds a generic function QActive_setAttr() to set thread attributes in various QP ports to 3rd-party RTOSes. This function is then used in the <a class="el" href="embos.html">embOS port</a> and the <a class="el" href="uc-os2.html">uC/OS-II port</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this release fixes the following bug in the <a class="el" href="threadx.html">ThreadX port</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/197">bug#197 "Problems with scheduler locking in QP/C/C++ ports to ThreadX"</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_0_3"></a>
Version 6.0.3, 2017-12-12</h1>
<p>Changes since version 6.0.1:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/193">bug#193 "QXK: context switch from extended to basic thread fails"</a></li>
<li>replaced attributes of <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_e_queue.html" title="Native QF Event Queue.">QEQueue</a> classes from type <code>uint_fastX_t</code> to <code>uintX_t</code>. For the ARM Cortex-M port, these changes reduce the memory footprint of each <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> instance from 50 to 38 bytes (25% improvement).</li>
<li>improved the performance of the ARM Cortex-M0/M0+ ports, which do not support the CLZ (count leading zeros) instruction. All QP ports to Cortex-M0/M0+ (qv, qk and qxk) now contain hand-optimized assembly implementation of the LOG2 (log-base-2) function. The implementation executes only in 14 machine instructions and uses only 16-byte look-up-table (LUT). This replaces LOG2 implementation based on a 256-byte LUT.</li>
<li>changed the interrupt disabling policy in ARM Cortex-M ports back to "unconditional interrupt disabling", which is simpler and faster than "saving-and-restoring interrupt status".</li>
<li>added a port to ARM Cortex-M with the LLVM compiler (currently only for the dual-mode <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel). Unlike the other ARM Cortex-M ports, the port to LLVM uses the "saving-and-restoring interrupt status" interrupt disabling policy (explicit request from a commercial customer).</li>
<li>removed ARM Cortex-M port and examples for the TI-ARM compiler. (Projects for the TI CCS can use the GNU-ARM toolchain and the existing GNU-ARM ports).</li>
<li>Added the DPP-COMP example (Dining Philosophers Problem) with the "Orthogonal Component" state pattern located in <code>qpc/examples/win32/dpp-comp</code>. This example demonstrates also a partitioned QM model into external packages for the Container (Table active object) and the Components (Philo active objects).</li>

Version 6.0.1, 2017-11-10</h1>
<p>The main focus of this release is to fix the remaining problems with transitions out of eXit-Points in sub-machines. Specifically, this release modifies the QMsm-based state machine implementation strategy (file <a class="el" href="qep__msm_8c.html">src/qf/qep_msm.c</a> to properly handle transitions from eXit-Points to Entry-Points and from eXit-Points to History connectors in sub-machines. These changes are part of fixing the following bugs reported for QM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/190">bug#190 "Exit-Point segment targeting History doesn't work"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/189">bug#189 "Exit-Point segment targeting an Entry-Point to sub-machine state doesn't work"</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this release fixes the following bug in transitions to "shallow history":</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/191">bug#191 "Transition to shallow history in QMsm causes assertion qep_msm#810"</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The bug#191 is fixed by modifying the function QMsm_childStateObj_() in <a class="el" href="qep__msm_8c.html">qep_msm.c</a> to return the parent state in the corner case when the current state is the parent state.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This QP/C 6.0.1 release is the minimum version required in QM 4.1.0. This is because QM 4.1.0 assumes the modified QMsm-state machine implementation strategy in order to properly handle the various transitions out of eXit-Points in sub-machine states.</dd></dl>
<p>Additionally, this release changes the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> implementation related to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/186">bug#186 "QXK: Extended thread context switch causes assertion in PendSV_Handler"</a>. Specifically, the case of context switching away and back to the same thread (which can arise under specific interrupt preemption scenarios) is now handled as a simple return from PendSV. The <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> scheduler has been modified to set the "next" thread pointer to NULL when it detects switching back to the "current" thread.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_6_0_0"></a>
Version 6.0.0, 2017-10-13</h1>
<p>This release fixes two bugs found in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/185">bug#185</a> "QXK: PendSV_Handler uses inconsistent stack frames for saving and restoring AO for Cortex-M0(+)"</li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/186">bug#186</a> "QXK: Extended thread context switch causes assertion in PendSV_Handler"</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, this release includes a fix for the bug found in ARM Cortex-M0 port with the GNU-ARM compiler:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/184">bug#189</a> "QS_END() leaves all interrupts disabled with GNU-ARM"</li>
</ul>
<p>This specific problem observed in QSpy turned out to be caused by a bug in the GNU-ARM compiler itself. This problem affected the ARMv6-M architecture (Cortex-M0/M0+/M1) and manifested itself in generation of incorrect code for the QP critical section at certain gcc optimization levels (such as -O). This bug was first discovered and filed as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/184">bug#184</a>. The bug affected the GNU-ARM ports to all built-in kernels <a class="el" href="srs_qv.html">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="srs_qk.html">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="srs_qxk.html">QXK</a>.</p>

Version 5.9.9, 2017-09-29</h1>
<p>This release implements the feature request <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/132">#132 "Extend the QXK mutex to support also simple operation without the priority-ceiling protocol"</a>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This release is completely backwards-compatible with the <a class="el" href="history.html#qpc_5_9_8">previous QP/C release 5.9.8</a>.</dd></dl>
<p>Specifically, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_mutex.html" title="Blocking Mutex of the QXK preemptive kernel.">QXMutex</a> class has been extended as follows:</p><ul>
<li>a mutex initialized with ceiling==0 (QXMutex_init(0)) means "no ceiling", so such mutex will NOT use the priority-ceiling protocol.</li>
<li>in this case the mutex will NOT require a unique priority level</li>
<li>in this case the mutex will not change (boost) the priority of the holding thread in the QXMutex_lock() operation.</li>
<li>in this case the mutex will still support nesting of locks (as before), up to 255 levels of nesting.</li>
<li>when initialized with <code>ceiling&gt;0</code>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_mutex.html" title="Blocking Mutex of the QXK preemptive kernel.">QXMutex</a> WILL use the priority-ceiling protocol, as before.

<p>Also, the pre-condition assertion in the function QF_newRef_() (file <code><a class="el" href="qf__dyn_8c.html">src/qf/qf_dyn.c</a></code>) has been modified to allow creating event references only for dynamic events <code>(e-&gt;poolId_ == 0)</code>.</p>
<p>Improved comments in the source code.</p>
<p>Modified ARM Cortex-M examples with the GNU-ARM toolset to be consistent with QP/C++ (support for RTTI and C++ Exception handling), as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed definitions of <code>_init()</code> and <code>_fini()</code> from the GNU-ARM startup code for all supported boards in the <code>3rd_party</code> directory</li>
<li>commented out the call to <code>__libc_init_array()</code> in the GNU-ARM startup code for all supported boards in the <code>3rd_party</code> directory (because it requires <code>_init()</code>)</li>

Version 5.9.6, 2017-08-04</h1>
<p>The main focus of this release are improvements to the "dual-mode" <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel. Specifically, this release implements the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/128/" class="extern">featrue request #128 "QP Semaphore Max Value Setting"</a> for <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>. This feature changes the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> function QXSemaphore_init(), which now takes additional parameter <code>count</code>. This parameter specifies the maximum allowed count for the semaphore (e.g., count of 1 makes the semaphore a binary-semaphore).</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This change breaks backwards-compatibility with the existing code that uses the QXSemaphore_init() function.</dd></dl>
<p>This release also fixes a bug inside the assertions in QXSemaphore_signal(), where the check for the extended-thread is performed.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds assertions to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> code, which ensure that any available blocking calls can only be made from extended-threads and not from basic-threads (active objects) or ISRs.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds protection in the IRQ priorities initialization in QK/QV/QXK for ARM Cortex-M3/M4/M7, so that the number of IRQs is extracted from bits 0-2 of the ICTR register (INTLINESNUM).</p>
<p>Finally, this release consistently changes all example projects (for all toolchains) to use the <b>src</b> directory for QP/C source code, instead of the <b>source</b> directory. The source/ directory is now truly obsolete, but is still provided in this release for backwards compatibility with user projects.</p>

Version 5.9.5, 2017-07-20</h1>
<p>This release changes the macro <a class="el" href="qxk_8h.html#aab6a4fe65f8febf1bab4b619fc861e7e">QXTHREAD_START()</a> in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel so that it can be used only with <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_thread.html" title="eXtended (blocking) thread of the QXK preemptive kernel">QXThread</a> pointers and not <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> pointers.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The change of <a class="el" href="qxk_8h.html#aab6a4fe65f8febf1bab4b619fc861e7e">QXTHREAD_START()</a> has impact on existing <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> applications, because the calls like <code>QXTHREAD_START(&amp;XT_Test1-&gt;super ~~~)</code> need to be changed to <code>QXTHREAD_START(XT_Test1 ~~~)</code>, where XT_Test1 is a pointer to <code><a class="el" href="struct_q_x_thread.html" title="eXtended (blocking) thread of the QXK preemptive kernel">QXThread</a> *</code>.</dd></dl>
<p>This release fixes the following bugs:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/178/" class="extern">bug#178</a> "GNU-ARM compiler reports "Error: unaligned opcodes~~~" in startup code for QP/C/C++/nano examples". The bug fix entails modifying the startup code for the GNU-ARM compiler in the <code>3rd_party</code> directory. Specifically, the proper alignment directives have been added to the inline assembly in the exception handlers.</li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/179/" class="extern">bug#179</a> "Assertion ID 210 fires when signaling on a QXK semaphore"</li>
</ul>
<p>This release fixes the naming problem of the startup code for the STM32F7-Discovery board (in the <code>3rd_party/stm32f7-discovery/gnu/ and arm/</code> directories), where the startup code was renamed from <code>startup_stm32f4xx.c/s</code> to <code>startup_stm32f746xx.c/s</code>. The change has been also made in the example projects for the STM32F7-Discovery board (for ARM-KEIL and GNU-ARM toolsets).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_9_4"></a>
Version 5.9.4, 2017-07-07</h1>
<p>This release adds Thread-Local Storage (TLS) feature for the dual-mode <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel (see srs_qxk_tls).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_9_3"></a>
Version 5.9.3, 2017-06-19</h1>
<p>This release implements the feature request <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/126/" target="_blank" class="extern">#126</a> "Allow non-asserting
event allocation for zero-margin allocations". Specifically, calling <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a9da2c27f98ee35a75caeec5710bafb8a">Q_NEW_X()</a> or <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a766856b24aa5163b7ca90bc3432f1e3e">QACTIVE_POST_X()</a> with the margin argument of zero will no longer assert if the allocation/posting fails.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_9_2"></a>
Version 5.9.2, 2017-06-05</h1>
<p>This release adapts the Makefiles for GNU-ARM to the new location of the GNU-ARM toolset, which is now included in the QTools Collection (v 5.9.1) for Windows.</p>
<p>Also, this release improves the flash loading scripts for the JLink hardware debugger (for GNU-ARM projects for the EFM32-SLSTK3401A board). Specifically, the JLink configuration file for flash download is generated by the flash batch script based on the command-line parameter (the binary file to load into the flash). This eliminates the need to manually maintain JLink configuration files.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds bi-directional QP/Spy to the embOS example project for the STM32F4-Discovery board.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds GNU-ARM port to uC/OS-II and adds GNU-ARM example project for the EK-TM4C123GXL board.</p>
<p>Finally, this release implements the feature request #125 "Include QPC
Demo application for STM32F4 processor without RTOS" (see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/125/">https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/125/</a> ). The DPP demo for the STM32F4-Discovery board has been added in the directory: qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_stm32f4-discovery . This demo includes <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernels and ARM-Keil, GNU-ARM, and IAR-ARM toolsets. The demos support bi-directional QP/Spy.</p>

<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/169/" target="_blank" class="extern">bug#169 "Submachine-state eXit Point does not work correctly"</a></li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The bug only affects sub-machines and does not affect any other aspects of QMsm-style state machines.</dd></dl>
<p>Also, this release changes the organization of the QP/C source code to make it more friendly for the Eclipse CDT, as proposed in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/feature-requests/123/" target="_blank" class="extern">feature request #123 "Eclipse-friendly source directory structure for QP/C/C++"</a>. Specifically, the QP/C source code is now provided in the <code>qpc/src/</code> directory with the following structure:</p>
<pre class="fragment">qpc/
  +-source/  - existing source directory with "flat" structure
  |            (for backwards-compatibility)

<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_9_0"></a>
Version 5.9.0, 2017-05-19</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this milestone QP/C release is to provide support for the powerful <b>Unit Testing Framework</b> called <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html" target="_blank" class="extern"><b>QUTest&trade;</b> (pronounced <em>cutest</em>)</a>. QUTest&trade; is the fundamental tooling for Test-Driven Development (TDD) of QP/C applications, which is a highly recommended best-practice. This release introduces changes in the QS-RX (receive) channel and adds several new callbacks.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The signature of the QS_onCommand() has changed and the function now takes 3 arbitrary 32-bit parameters instead of one. This introduces backwards-incompatibility with previous code that used QS_onCommand().</dd></dl>
<p>This release also changes the critical section for QP/C ports to ARM Cortex-M in that the policy of "save and restore interrupt status" is used. This policy permits nesting of critical sections, which was requested by customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release changes the selective interrupt disabling for ARM Cortex-M3/4/7 (with the BASEPRI register) to address the hardware problem on ARM Cortex-M7 core r0p1 (<a href="https://www.state-machine.com/doc/Cortex-M7_Software_Developers_Errata_Notice_v8.pdf">SDEN-1068427, erratum 837070</a>). The QP ports to ARM Cortex-M3/4/7 now implement the workaround recommended by ARM, which is to surround MSR BASEPRI with the "CPSID i"/"CPSIE i" pair. This workaround works also for Cortex-M3/M4 cores.</p>
<p>New ports:</p><ul>
<li>ports/win32-qutest folder contains port to QUTest for Windows</li>
<li>ports/posix-qutest folder contains port to QUTest for POSIX (Linux)</li>
<li>ports/arm-cm/qutest folder contains port to QUTest for ARM Cortex-M</li>
</ul>
<p>New examples:</p><ul>
<li>examples/qutest/dpp folder contains the QUTest DPP test for various platforms (Win32, EFM32-SLSTK3401A and EK-TM4C123GXL)</li>
<li>examples/qutest/qhsmtst folder contains the QUTest test for the QHsmTst state machine (structural test)</li>
<li>examples/qutest/qmsmtst folder contains the QUTest test for the QMsmTst state machine (structural test)</li>
<li>examples/qutest/self_test folder contains the QUTest self-test for various features of QUTest</li>
<li>examples/qutest/TDDbook_Flash folder contains the QUTest of a flash memory driver from Chapter 10 of the "TDD-book" by James Grenning.</li>
<li>examples/qutest/TDDbook_LedDriver folder contains the QUTest of a flash memory driver from Chapters 3&amp;4 of the "TDD-book" by James Grenning.</li>
<li>examples/qutest/TDDbook_Sprintf folder contains the QUTest of a flash memory driver from Chapter 1 of the "TDD-book" by James Grenning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Updates of 3rd_party software:</p><ul>
<li>the 3rd_party/CMSIS folder has been updated to CMSIS 5.0.2.</li>
<li>the 3rd_party/embOS folder has been updated to embOS 4.34.1</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, this release fixes the following bugs:</p><ul>
<li>bug#162 "QF critical sections require modification for M7 core"</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_8_2"></a>
Version 5.8.2, 2017-02-08</h1>
<p>This release adds examples for the ARM Cortex-<b>M7</b> CPU. Specifically, the release contains the standard <a class="el" href="tut_dpp.html">Dining Philosophers Problem (DPP)</a> examples for the STM32F746G-Discovery board, all built-in kernels (<a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>), and ARM-KEIL, IAR EWARM, GNU-ARM toolsets.</p>
<p>To provide examples for STM32F746G-Discovery board, the release now provides the folder <code>3rd_party/stm32f7-discovery</code> with the support code for the STM32F7xx MCUs, which contains parts of STM32CubeF7 library.</p>
<p>Also, the <code>3rd_party/CMSIS</code> folder now provides the new CMSIS V5.0.1.</p>
<p>Finally, this release fixes the following bugs:</p><ul>
<li>bug#159 QP/C/C++ Win32 ports don't work on all x86 CPUs</li>
<li>bug#157 In QPC ucosii port, conversion of AO's priority to OS task priority is incorrect.</li>
<li>bug#152 Typo (qpc/ports/arm7-9/qk/gnu/qk_port.s:42) prevents compilation</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_8_1"></a>
Version 5.8.1, 2016-12-16</h1>
<p>This release is in response to a recent finding that many QP users of the ports to ARM Cortex-M3/M4 forget to explicitly set their interrupt priorities, as described in the AppNote <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_ARM-Cortex-M_Interrupt-Priorities.pdf" target="_blank" class="extern">"Setting ARM Cortex-M Interrupt Priorities in QP 5.x"</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, this release improves safety of QP ports to ARM Cortex-M3/M4, by initializing the interrupt priorities to a safe default in a generic, portable way. This QP port includes such a fix for QV/QK/QXK ports to ARM Cortex-M3/M4.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release introduces the new <a class="el" href="struct_q_ticker.html" title="&quot;Ticker&quot; Active Object class">QTicker</a> class, which is an efficient active object specialized to process <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> system clock tick at a specified tick frequency [0..(<a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#a2b5eb0c96105f58726359f4fcfae9530">QF_MAX_TICK_RATE</a> - 1)]. Placing system clock tick processing in an active object allows you to remove the non-deterministic <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a1f1970e16f4d010b5e5b2fd046aac41e">QF_TICK_X()</a> processing from the interrupt level and move it into the thread-level, where you can prioritize it as low as you wish.</p>

Version 5.8.0, 2016-11-30</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this milestone QP/C release is to finally provide the baseline framework fully compatible with the upcoming QM 4.0.0.</p>
<p>This release changes the class hierarchy so that <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> becomes the base class of <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a>. Also, <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> becomes the base class of <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a>, which reverses the changes introduced in version 4.1.</p>
<p>The modified class hierarchy better reflects the fact that <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> state machine implementation strategy is simpler and supports less functionality than the more advanced <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> strategy. For example, only the <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> class fully supports sub-machines and sub-machine states that are the main feature of QM 4.x. This clean progression of supported functionality from subclasses to superclasses allows QM to easier check and enforce that advanced features are not generated for subclasses that don't have the required capabilities. (With previous class hierarchy with <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> as the base class all subclasses, including <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a>, would technically inherit the advanced functionality, which is not the case).</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>All changes in QP/C 5.8.0 remain transparent for the existing QP/C applications, because of the provided backwards compatibility layer in <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html" title="QP/C interface including the backwards-compatibility layer.">qpc.h</a>.</dd></dl>
<p>Also, this release changes the implementation of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernels in that the ready-set representing active threads is cleared only <em>after</em> completion of the RTC-step, not when the last event is removed from the corresponding event queue. In case of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel this change fixes the high-priority <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/147/">bug#147</a>. But even in case of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> kernels, where this behavior didn't lead to any bugs, the policy better reflects the semantics of the ready-set.</p>
<p>This release also updates the CMSIS interface included in the 3rd_party/CMSIS folder to the latest CMSIS-5.</p>
<p>All examples and QM models have been updated to the new upcoming QM 4.0.0. All these models require QM 4.x.</p>

In other words, <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> executes active objects (basic threads) like the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> kernel using the single stack (Main Stack on ARM Cortex-M), but can also execute traditional <em>blocking</em> threads (extended threads).</p>
<p>Only the extended threads (<a class="el" href="struct_q_x_thread.html" title="eXtended (blocking) thread of the QXK preemptive kernel">QXThread</a> class) need their private stack spaces and the overhead of the full context switch. The basic threads (<a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> classes) run efficiently using the main stack with much lower context switch overhead.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> examples have been updated for more thorough demonstration of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> features. The <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> examples are available in the following directories: dpp_efm32-slstk3401a, dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl, and dpp_nucleo-l053r8.</p>
<p>This release fixes several issues in <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> 5.7.1-beta with handling timeouts while blocking in extended-threads, such as timed blocking on event queues and semaphores.</p>
<p>This release also changes the internal <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> implementation to match the terminology applied in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel (e.g., QK_sched_() has been renamed to QK_activate_() and QK_schedPrio_() to QK_sched_()). These changes fall into the category of refactoring and have no impact on the API or performance.</p>
<p>Finally, this release improves the implementation of scheduler locking in publish-subscribe event delivery.</p>

Version 5.7.0, 2016-08-31</h1>
<p>This release adds support for sub-machines and sub-machine states for reusing pieces of state machines (an advanced UML concept) to the QMsm-state machine implementation strategy. This feature is to match the upcoming QM 4.0.0.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds support for the ARM Cortex-R processor. Specifically, the release contains a generic port to ARM Cortex-R with the IAR and TI-CCS toolsets and examples for the TI Hercules TMS570LS12x safety MCU (LAUNCHPADXL2-TMS57012).</p>
<p>Also, this release changes once more the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> port to ARM Cortex-M, to reduce the interrupt latecy. This has been achieved by shortening the critical section in the PendSV exception.</p>
<p>Also, this release changes slightly the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> port to ARM Cortex-M, where again the critical section in PendSV has been slightly shortened.</p>
<p>Finally, this release replaces all absolute paths with relative paths in all CCS-Eclipse project files (for TivaC, Hercules, and MSP430).</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modified <a class="el" href="qep__msm_8c.html">qep_msm.c</a> to correct the support for sub-machines and sub-machine states</li>

Version 5.6.5, 2016-06-06</h1>
<p>This release adds support for the new board: EFM32-SLSTK3401A (Pearl Gecko Starter Kit from Silicon Labs). This board replaces the Stellaris EK-LM3S811 board, which has been discontinued. (The Stellaris EK-LM3S811 board had been used in the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game example accompanying the PSiCC2 book).</p>
<p>This release also introduces a new version of the QWIN GUI Toolkit in the Windows prototypes for the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game and the DPP-GUI version (see <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qtools/#QWin">https://www.state-machine.com/products/qtools/#QWin</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, this release also includes the QP/C integration with the emWin emgedded GUI from SEGGER, which is also the same product as uC/GUI distributed by Micrium (exa_emwin).</p>
<p>Finally, this release comes with updated project files for TI Code Composer Studio (both for ARM Cortex-M and for MSP430).</p>
<p>This release fixes the following bugs:</p><ul>
<li>bug#130 (POSIX port stop-&gt;start leads to reuse of sestroyed mutex).</li>
<li>bug#131 (QF_newRef_ increments reference counter without QF_CRIT_ENTRY_()).</li>

<p>This release fixes a serious Bug #126 (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/126">https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/126</a> ) in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> preemptive scheduler introduced in QP 5.6.2.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_6_2"></a>
Version 5.6.2, 2016-03-31</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to introduce <em>atomic event multicasting</em>, meaning that event publishing to all subscribers is now protected from preemption. This eliminates potential for re-ordering of events under preemptive kernels (such as <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>, or 3rd-party RTOSes), when events are published from low-priority AOs and some higher-priority subscribers can preempt multicasting and post/publish events of their own (before the original event is posted to all subscribers).</p>
<p>The atomic event multicasting is implemented by means of selective scheduler locking&ndash;very much like a priory-ceiling mutex. During event multicasting the scheduler gets locked, but only up to the highest-priority subscriber to a given event. The whole point here is that active objects with priorities above such "priority ceiling" are <em>not</em> affected. Please see the discussion thread:</p>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/discussion/668726/thread/c186bf45">https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/discussion/668726/thread/c186bf45</a></p>
<p>This release also changes the implementation of the priority-ceiling mutex in the preemptive built-in kernels: <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>. Specifically, the implementation now re-uses the selective scheduler locking mechanism. In this new implementation, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_mutex.html" title="Blocking Mutex of the QXK preemptive kernel.">QXMutex</a> of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel is much more efficient and lightweight, but it <em>cannot block</em> while holding a mutex.</p>
<p>Finally, this release changes the QP ports to 3rd-party RTOSes by performing any RTOS operations (like posting events to message queues) outside critical sections. Also the ports have been augmented to support scheduler locking (this feature depends on what's available in the specific RTOSes).</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Added scheduler locking to QF_publish_() in <a class="el" href="qf__ps_8c.html">qf_ps.c</a>. This feature is added in a portable way, via macros #QF_SCHED_STAT_TYPE_, <a class="el" href="qk_8h.html#a878bb55cc1ec0151021256ccfa18b0c8">QF_SCHED_LOCK_()</a> and <a class="el" href="qk_8h.html#ae105405c9dde7fbeb959f318d0c9ac6d">QF_SCHED_UNLOCK_()</a>, which need to be implemented in every QP port.</li>

<li>Modified embOS port to provide (global) scheduler locking, which affects all priorities, because that's all embOS supports. Also, modified the embOS port to perform event posting outside the <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> critical section.</li>
<li>Modified uC/OS-II port to provide (global) scheduler locking, which affects all priorities, because that's all uC/OS-II supports.

Also, modified the ThreadX port to perform event posting outside the <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> critical section.</li>
<li>Changed the ThreadX example to run on ARM Cortex-M4 board (STM32DiscoveryF4), instead of Win32 emulation (see qpc/examples/threadx/arm-cm/dpp_stm32f429-discovery).</li>
<li>Modified the Win32 port to provide (global) scheduler locking, which is implemented by Win32 critical section.</li>
<li>Fixed Bug#122 (QP didn't initiate some internal variables) <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/122/">https://sourceforge.net/p/qpc/bugs/122/</a> by adding explicit clearing of all QP variables in <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html#adac7eccb860d910c4e446d3143798bba">QF_init()</a>.</li>
<li>Modified the POSIX port to dummy-out scheduler locking. This means that this port currently does NOT lock scheduler around event publishing. (At this point it is not clear how to implement POSIX scheduler locking in a portable way.)</li>

Version 5.6.1, 2016-01-01</h1>
<p>This release is the first official (production) release of the new blocking <a class="el" href="srs_qxk.html">QXK</a> kernel.</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Added error directives to source files from different built-in kernels (<a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a>) to generate meaningful error messages when these files are mixed in one project.

</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_6_0"></a>
Version 5.6.0-beta, 2015-12-24</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this <em>beta</em> release is to introduce a new component of the QP/C framework called <a class="el" href="srs_qxk.html">QXK</a> ("eXtended Quantum Kernel"). <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> is a small, preemptive, priority-based, <b>blocking</b> kernel that provides most features you might expect of a traditional blocking RTOS kernel.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> has been designed specifically for applications that need to mix event-driven active objects with traditional blocking code, such as commercial middleware (TCP/IP stacks, UDP stacks, embedded file systems, etc.) or legacy software. The <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel is integrated tightly and optimally with the rest of the QP. It reuses all mechanisms already provided in QP, thus avoiding any code duplication, inefficient layers of indirection, and additional licensing costs, which are inevitable when using 3rd-party RTOS kernels to run QP/C applications.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> documentation is available in the QP/C Reference Manual at <a class="el" href="srs_qxk.html">Preemptive Dual-Mode Kernel</a></dd></dl>
<p>Additionally, this release removes the macros Q_ROM, Q_ROM_BYTE, and Q_ROM_VAR from the QP/C code. These macros have been necessary for odd Harvard-architecture 8-bit CPUs (such as AVR, 8051) to place constant data in ROM. As QP/C stopped supporting those CPUs, the non-standard extensions could be removed from the QP/C code base.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release re-designs the priority-ceiling mutex in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> kernel, which now works the same as the mutex of the new <a class="el" href="struct_q_x_k.html" title="QXK dual-mode kernel (QXK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QXK</a> kernel. Also, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> ports to ARM Cortex-M no longer need or use the SVC_Handler (Supervisor Call). This is done to make the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> ports compatible with various "hypervisors" (such as mbed uVisor or Nordic SoftDevice), which use the SVC exception.</p>
<p>Finally, this release modifies the GNU-ARM ports of <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> for ARM Cortex-M, to use the __ARM_ARCH macro to distinguish among different architectures (ARCHv6 vs ARCHv7).</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_5_1"></a>
Version 5.5.1, 2015-10-05</h1>
<p>The main focus of this release is to improve the AAPCS compliance of the ARM Cortex-M port to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> preemptive kernel. Specifically, the PendSV handler in assembly did not always maintain the 8-byte stack alignment, which is required by AAPCS. This version corrects the stack misalignment in the qk_port.s files for all supported ARM compilers (ARM-Keil, GNU, IAR, and TI CCS). All these ports should also be ready for ARM Cortex-M7.</p>
<p>Also, this release adds support for the TI CCS ARM compiler. Specifically, a new ARM Cortex-M ports have been added (in directories <code>qpc/ports/arm-cm/qk/ti/</code> and <code>qpc/ports/arm-cm/qk/ti/</code>) and TI CCS example projects have been provided (in directories <code>qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl/qk/ti/</code> and <code>qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl/qv/ti/</code>).</p>
<p>Finally, this release corrects a bug in the DPP example for EK-TM4C123GXL with the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> (Vanilla) cooperative kernel. Specifically, the file <code>qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl/qv/bsp.c</code> did not re-enable interrupts in the QV_onIdle() callback.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_5_0"></a>
Version 5.5.0, 2015-09-04</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is the extension of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing system to bi-directional communication with embedded Targets. Specifically, the QS-RX (receive channel for <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a>) has been added with the following capabilities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set global <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> filters inside the Target</li>
<li>Set local <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> filters inside the Target</li>
<li>Inject an arbitrary event to the Target (direct post or publish)</li>
<li>Execute a user-defined callback function inside the Target with arguments supplied from QSPY</li>
<li>Peek data inside the Target and send to QSPY</li>
<li>Poke data (supplied from QSPY) into the Target</li>
<li>Execute clock tick inside the Target</li>
<li>Request target information (version, all sizes of objects, build time-stamp)</li>
<li>Remotely reset of the Target</li>
</ol>
<p>This QP/C version complements the recent release of Qtools 5.5.0, where the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qspy ">QSPY host application</a> has been extended with a UDP socket, which is open for communication with various Front-Ends (GUI-based or headless). An example Front-End written in Tcl/Tk called "QspyView" has been developed to demonstrate all the features. The example application located in the directory qpc/examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl/qspy contains customization of the "qspyview" script for the DPP application. Please refer to the documentation of this example (arm-cm_dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl) for more information.</p>
<p>Finally, this release adds a state machine operation for implementing the shallow history mechanism. The operation is called "childState", because it computes a child state of a given parent, such that the child belongs to the same state hierarchy as the current state.</p>

Version 5.4.2, 2015-06-04</h1>
<p>The main focus of this release is to improve the support for "dual targeting" of QP/C applications, which is developing of deeply embedded code as much as possible on the desktop OS, such as Windows. Experience shows that "dual targeting" dramatically improves productivity of embedded systems developers, perhaps more than any other technique.</p>
<p>This release makes it possible to use exactly the <b>same</b> application code, main function, and the Board Support Package interface (bsp.h) on both deeply embedded target and on Windows. The only differences between these targets can be completely encapsulated in the Board Support Package implementation (bsp.c).</p>
<p>The support for "dual targeting" in this QP/C release works both for Win32 console and Win32 GUI applications. The Win32-GUI support enables developers to easily emulate the front-panels of the embedded devices, with LCD-screens (graphical and segmented), LEDs, buttons, switches, sliders, etc.</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modified the QP/C ports to Windows (both <a class="el" href="win32.html">Win32 API (Multithreaded)</a> and <a class="el" href="win32-qv.html">Win32-QV (Single Threaded)</a>) so that they support both Win32 console and Win32-GUI applications. The newly introduced pre-processor #WIN32_GUI macro is now required to use the Win32-GUI facilities.</li>
<li>Added portable "safe" macros from <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code> to the QP/C ports to Windows. These macros encapsulate the differences between Microsoft Visual C++ and other compilers (such as MinGW).</li>
<li>Simplified the structure of the QP/C Windows ports by eliminating one level of directories for the compilers used. Both VC++ and MinGW builds can now be run in the same port directory.</li>
<li>Modified the <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html#adf9cb86740bf55c5ad55c1d44fd35921">QF_stop()</a> function in the QP/C port to <a class="el" href="win32-qv.html">Win32-QV (Single Threaded)</a>, so that it unblocks the <a class="el" href="struct_q_v.html" title="QV non-preemptive, cooperative kernel (QV namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QV</a> event-loop and thus lets the application terminate.</li>
<li>Modified all examples for Windows to use the new port structure.</li>
<li>Improved all Makefiles (for the MinGW toolset) in all Windows examples, to make them easier to adapt to custom applications, both Win32 console and Win32 GUI.</li>
<li>Moved several examples from the <code>examples/win32/</code> and examples/win32-qv directories to <code>examples/arm-cm/</code> directory with native embedded examples for ARM Cortex-M. This co-location of the Win32 emulation with the embedded code running on the actual board demonstrates better the "dual targeting" development approach.</li>
<li>Updated all Windows examples to the latest QP API by compiling the code with the macro <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3d046e1bb0df20880186bd32a31684f0">QP_API_VERSION</a> set to 9999 (latest API without backwards compatibility)</li>
<li>Improved the PC-Lint support for checking the application-level code located in in <code>examples/arm-cm/dpp_ek-tm4c123gxl/lint</code></li>

Version 5.4.1, 2015-05-14</h1>
<p>This release changes the active object class hierarchy so that <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> is now more fundamental and is the base class for <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a>. (Previously <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> was a subclass of <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a>). The newly added documentation section about QP/C Design shows the current class hierarchy.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Because the types <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> are equivalent in QP/C, this change has minimal impact on the applications, but it is now more correct to use <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> as the base class for all "opaque" active object pointers.</dd></dl>
<p>Also, this release brings several cosmetic improvements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All QM models included in examples have been modified to use the <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> "opaque" pointers.</li>
<li>All QM models have been saved with QM 3.3.0, which means that they will not open with QM 3.2.x or earlier QM versions.</li>
<li>The ROM-able QP version string QP_versionStr[] has been added and used consistently in the macros QEP_getVersion(), QF_getVersion(), QK_getVersion(), QV_getVersion(), and QS_getVersion() macros.</li>
<li>The <code>qpc/ports/arm-cm/qk/gnu/qk_port.s</code> ARM Cortex-M port to <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> with GNU has been modified to use the CMSIS-compliant symbol __FPU_PRESENT instead of the FPU_VFP_V4_SP_D16 symbol.</li>
<li>All Makefiles for the GNU toolset have been cleaned up, whereas any <code>/</code> (back-slash) characters in the paths have been repalced with <code>/</code> (forward-slash) characters. Also all these Makefiles have been updated to provide the __FPU_PRESENT to C and assembler when the hardware FPU is used.</li>
<li>The file display drver for the EK-LM2S811 board locate at <code>qpc/3rd_party/ek-lm3s811/display96x16x1.c</code> has been modified to fix the problem with incorrect hardware delay with the GNU compiler at higher levels of optimization. The in-line assembly for the GNU compiler has been updated such that the delay loop cannot be "optimized away".</li>
<li>Several README files have been updated.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_4_0"></a>
Version 5.4.0, 2015-04-26</h1>
<p>This release changes the basic philosophy of distributing the QP frameworks by <b>combining</b> the "QP/C Baseline Code" with all currently available "QP/C Development Kits" (QDK/C). This is done to eliminate any potential mistakes in downloading and installing separate pieces of code.</p>
<p>Additionally, this release changes the basic philosophy of building your embedded applications with the QP/C framework. Starting with this release, all <a class="el" href="exa.html">examples</a> for embedded boards include the QP/C framework as <b>source code</b> within the projects, instead of statically linking with a QP/C library. (<b>NOTE:</b> It is still possible to use QP/C as a library, but you need to build such libraries yourself, as they are no longer provided in the QP/C distribution.)</p>
<p>The move to building QP/C from sources ensures the consistent toolset version and compiler options applied to the application code as well as the QP/C framework code. (<b>NOTE:</b> The QP/C examples for "big operating systems", like Windows/POSIX, still use QP/C as a pre-compiled library that is statically linked with the application code.)</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Even though the QP/C source has been re-packaged in this release, there are no API changes to the code, so it remains <b>backwards compatible</b> with the existing applications. (Except the build process, which builds QP/C from sources rather than linking to the QP/C library.)</dd></dl>
<p>The two changes in basic approach to distributing and building the framework have also the following ripple effects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The QP/C source code has been simplified and has been re-packaged into a much smaller number of source files. The whole QP/C source code now resides in the single <span class="img folder"><b>source</b></span> folder. Additionally, the source code files have now the <b>read-only</b> protection to prevent inadvertent changes to the QP/C source code that is part of your projects.</li>
<li>It is no longer necessary to define the <b>QPC environment variable</b> to build the QP/C examples. All directories and files referenced by example projects are <b>relative</b> to the project folder. This change reflects the fact that most development tools add source files to the project using relative paths (and now the projects contain QP/C source code, not just the QP library).</li>
<li>The QP/C <span class="img folder"><a class="el" href="ports.html">Ports</a></span> folder has been reorganized to contain all currently available QP/C ports. The ports are organized into three categories: <a class="el" href="ports_native.html">native QP/C ports</a> ("bare-metal"), <a class="el" href="ports_rtos.html">ports to 3rd-party RTOSes</a>, and <a class="el" href="ports_gpos.html">ports to big operating systems</a> (Windows and Linux).(<b>NOTE</b>: the ports are now documented in the this <b>QP/C Reference Manual</b>. Each port sub-directory contains a <span class="img qp_link">README</span> link to the corresponding page in the online documentation)</li>
<li>The QP/C <span class="img folder"><a class="el" href="exa.html">Examples</a></span> folder has been reorganized to reduce the repetitions and contains all currently available QP/C examples. The folder includes four categories of examples: <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_native">native QP/C examples</a> ("bare-metal"), <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_rtos">examples for 3rd-party RTOSes</a>, <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_gpos">examples for big operating systems</a> (Windows and Linux), and examples for 3rd-party Middleware. As mentioned before, all example projects for embedded systems use QP/C as source code and not as a library. The <span class="img folder">examples</span> folder has been expanded to contain all currently available QP/C examples, many of them are new in this release. (<b>NOTE</b>: the currently available examples are now documented in the <b>QP/C Reference Manual</b>. Each example sub-directory contains a <span class="img qp_link">README</span> link to the corresponding page in the online documentation)</li>
<li>A new <span class="img folder">3rd_party</span> folder created to contain the Third-Party code used in the QP/C ports and examples, such as MCU register files, low-level startup code, device drivers, etc. The <span class="img folder">3rd_party</span> folder avoids the need to repeat such code in every project. Also, the separation of the Third-Party components helps to clearly indicate code that comes from various sources, and to which Quantum Leaps, LLC expressly makes <b>no claims of ownership</b>. The Third-Party software components included in this "3rd_party" folder are licensed under a variety of different licensing terms that are defined by the respective owners of this software and are spelled out in the README.txt or LICENSE.txt files included in the respective sub-folders.</li>
<li>This release also comes with the much expanded online <b>QP/C Reference Manual</b>, which is cross-linked with the ports and examples.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Renamed the "Vanilla" scheduler to the <a class="el" href="srs_qv.html">QV cooperative kernel</a> for symmetry with the <a class="el" href="srs_qk.html">QK preemptive kernel</a>. Renamed QF_onIdle() callback to QV_onIdle().</li>
<li>Removed class QFsm (which is now deprecated). Legacy state machines coded in the "QFsm-style" will continue to work, but will use the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> implementation internally. There is no longer any efficiency advantage in using the "QFsm-style" state machines.</li>
<li>Applied a slight performance improvement to the ARM Cortex-M port to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> preemptive kernel. The <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> port now checks for ISR context by looking at the IPSR register, instead of incrementing and decrementing the <code>QF_intNest_</code> up-down counter.</li>
<li>Updated ARM Cortex-M examples and provided new examples for NXP mbed-LPC1768, and STM32 NUCLEO-L053R8, and NUCLEO-L152RE boards. All examples now use the latest CMSIS (V4.3.0). All ARM Cortex-M examples are provided for the ARM-KEIL, GNU-ARM, and IAR-ARM toolsets.</li>
<li>Added the native port and examples to the classic ARM7/9 with AT91SAM7S-EK board and the IAR-ARM toolset.</li>
<li>Added the native port and examples to the AVR (AVRmega) with GNU-AVR and IAR-AVR toolsets. The examples are provided for the Arduino-UNO board.</li>
<li>Added the native <a class="el" href="msp430.html">port</a> and examples to MSP430 with TI CCS-430 and IAR-430 toolsets. The examples are provided for the MSP430 LauchPad board (MSP-EXP430F5529LP for the "classic" MSP430 and "extended" MSP430X, respectively).</li>
<li>Added port to CMSIS-RTOS RTX. Examples are available for TI EK-TM4C123GLX, STM32 NUCLEO-L053R8, and NUCLEO-L152RE boards with ARM-KEIL, GNU-ARM, and IAR-ARM toolsets.</li>
<li>Updated port to <a class="el" href="embos.html">embOS</a>. Examples are available for STM32 STM32F4-Discovery board with IAR-ARM toolset.</li>
<li>Updated port to <a class="el" href="freertos.html">FreeRTOS</a> for the latest version 8.2.1. Examples are available for TI EK-TM4C123GLX board with GNU-ARM and IAR-ARM toolsets.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="threadx.html">port to Thread-X</a>. Example is available for the Thread-X demo with Visual Studio on Windows.</li>
<li>Updated port to <a class="el" href="uc-os2.html">uC/OS-II</a> for the latest version v2.92. Examples are available for TI EK-TM4C123GLX and STM32 NUCLEO-L152RE boards with ARM-KEIL and IAR-ARM toolsets.</li>
<li>Updated <a class="el" href="win32.html">port to Win32</a> (Windows). Modified the port to apply a generous "fudge factor" in over-sizing QP event queues and event pools, to minimize the risk of overflowing queues/pools due to non-deterministic Windows behavior.</li>
<li>Added new <a class="el" href="win32-qv.html">port to Win32-QV</a> (Windows with cooperative "Vanilla" scheduler, previously known as Win32-1T).</li>
<li>Updated the lwIP-QP example for EK-LM3S6965 board.</li>

Version 5.3.1, 2014-09-19</h1>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>QP/C 5.3.1 remains backwards-compatible with all QP/C ports and applications</dd></dl>
<p>This release fixes the following bugs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a07a82a644aa2fdc946994db3e9e28974">QMsm_isInState()</a> returns invalid result (bug #105)</li>

<li>QF_gc() doc typo (bug #102)</li>
<li>POSIX-port Makefile error (bug #65)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, this release improves the uC/OS-II port in that it is now generic and applicable for any CPU, for which uC/OS-II port exists. Specifically, all references to DOS or x86 have been removed from the QP port and any CPU-specific dependencies have been placed in the separate part of the port.</p>
<p>Finally, this release improves the "QP/C Reference Manual" generated by Doxygen and available both inside the QP/C baseline distribution (qpc.chm file) and online at: <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpc">https://www.state-machine.com/qpc</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_3_0"></a>
Version 5.3.0, 2014-03-31</h1>
<p>This release adds the "transition to history" (deep history) feature to both <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> state machines and their subclasses. This QP/C release matches the new QM modeling tool version 3.1.0, which now supports the "transition to history" connector and the corresponding code generation for transitions to history.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>QP/C 5.3.0 remains backwards-compatible with QP/C applications developed for QP/C 4.x and QP/5.x. However, any QM models created for the previous QP/C versions require re-generating the code with QM 3.1.0.</dd></dl>
<p>This release adds new <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> (Quantum Spy) instrumentation for tracing transitions to history as well as entry and exit points in submachines. All these features require the matching QSPY host application included in Qtools 5.3.0.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> state machine has been extended to add implementation of the reusable submachine states and submachines with entry points and exit points. The reusable submachines in QP/C 5.3.0 lay the groundwork for providing reusable submachine states and submachine diagrams in the next upcoming QM version.</p>
<p>This release also goes several steps towards compliance with the new MISRA-C:2012 rules. For example, unused tag declarations have been removed (MISRA-C:2012 Rule 2.4), the C99 standard Boolean data type in &lt;stdbool.h&gt; has been added instead of uint8_t for stricter type analysis, and the C99 data types uint_fast8_t and uint_fast16_t are used instead of the non-standard uint_t.</p>
<p>Finally, this QP/C release brings deep changes in the source code comments and the doxygen documentation generated from the source code. All comments have now more consistent structure, and every function is now documented in the implementation file (.c file), whereas the interface (.h files) contain only the brief descriptions of the functions. This re-structuring of documentation is performed as part of the validation and verification effort that has begun to provide a certification package for QP/C for safety standards, such as IEC 61508 and ISO 62304 (FDA 510(k)).</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>

Version 5.2.1, 2014-01-06</h1>
<p>This release fixes two bugs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In file qmsm_dis.c added saving of the action-table into a temporary variable <em>before</em> exiting the current state to the transition source. Also, changed the signature of the QMsm_tran_() helper function to take the action table as parameter.

</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_2_0"></a>
Version 5.2.0, 2013-12-26</h1>
<p>This release matches the new QM 3.0.0, for which it provides model examples based on the new QMsm/QMActive classes. This, in turn demonstrates the new state machine code generation that QM3 was specifically designed to do.</p>
<p>This release also provides consistent API for late-binding ("virtual" functions) introduced in QP 5.0.0, as opposed to using regular linking (early-binding) for direct function calls, such as QHsm_dispatch(). A clearly separated API compatibility layer is provided, whereas you can configure a level of backwards compatibility by means of the <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3d046e1bb0df20880186bd32a31684f0">QP_API_VERSION</a> macro. This facilitates migrating existing QP applications to the newer API.</p>
<p>An cyclomatic complexity (McCabe V(G)) analysis of this version has been performed and the maximum V(G) complexity per function has been reduced to 15 by breaking up the QHsm_dispatch_() function. The code metrics report, including cyclomatic complexity by function as well as other standard code metrics (e.g., lines of code), is now included in the "QP/C Reference Manual", see <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/metrics.html">https://www.state-machine.com/qpc/metrics.html</a></p>
<p>Also, in this release all internal QP data that were previously uninitialized are now explicitly initialized to zero. In other words, this release no longer assumes that all uninitialized data (global and static inside functions) is implicitly initialized to zero before the control is transferred to main(). This is a requirement of the C Standard, but some embedded startup code fails to do this.</p>
<p>Finally, this release demonstrates safer stack allocation and safer exception handlers in all ARM Cortex-M examples. The techniques are described in the Embedded.com article "Are We Shooting Ourselves in the
Foot with Stack Overflow?".</p>

<li>In file qep.h renamed the implementation functions, such as QHsm_init() and QHsm_dispatch() to QHsm_init_() and QHsm_dispatch_() (note the underscore, which means that the functions should not be called directly by the application code).

The latter macros implement late-binding ("virtual" functions in C).</li>
<li>In file qf.h renamed the implementation functions, such as QActive_start(), QActive_post() and QActive_postLIFO() to QActive_start_(), QActive_post_(), and QActive_postLIFO_, respectively (note the underscore, which means that the functions should not be called directly by the application code). The only correct way of calling the functions is through the macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a4cdbac20a04929fedd879615f0ddda00">QACTIVE_START()</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ab7c56990d949c8708e3fe2b737f2e65c">QACTIVE_POST()</a>, and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a2f94b69fa7148180c19d501ce2ee7032">QACTIVE_POST_LIFO()</a>, respectively. The latter macros implement late-binding ("virtual" functions in C).</li>
<li>for backwards compatibility, in file <a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html" title="Sample QP/C port.">qp_port.h</a> defined "API
Compatibility Layer", which is controlled by the macro <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3d046e1bb0df20880186bd32a31684f0">QP_API_VERSION</a>. For example, specifying QP_API_VERSION=500 chooses API compatible with QP version 5.0.0 or newer, but excludes APIs that became deprecated in the earlier versions. If the macro <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3d046e1bb0df20880186bd32a31684f0">QP_API_VERSION</a> is not defined by the user (typically on the command line for the compiler), the default value of 0 is assumed. This default means maximum backwards compatibility (from version 0.0.0). On the other hand, higher values of <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3d046e1bb0df20880186bd32a31684f0">QP_API_VERSION</a> mean less backwards compatibility. For example QP_API_VERSION=9999 will specify compatibility only with the latest version of QP. The API Compatibility Layer for QP_API_VERSION &lt; 500 provides macros: QHsm_init(), QHsm_dispatch(), QActive_start(), QActive_post() and QActive_postLIFO(). These macros resolve to <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a8356802b7936cf2b3eafba6f82fdf53f">QMSM_INIT()</a> and <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a6301861b22df883470e7121ead46ecf7">QMSM_DISPATCH()</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a4cdbac20a04929fedd879615f0ddda00">QACTIVE_START()</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ab7c56990d949c8708e3fe2b737f2e65c">QACTIVE_POST()</a> and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a2f94b69fa7148180c19d501ce2ee7032">QACTIVE_POST_LIFO()</a> respectively, so that calls based on the older API also use late-binging.</li>
<li>In file qhsm_dis.c, broken up the function QHsm_dispatch() into two functions QHsm_dispatch_() and QHsm_tran_(). This has reduced the cyclomatic complexity from 25 for the original function, to 11 and 15 for QHsm_dispatch_() and QHsm_tran_(), respectively.</li>
<li>In file qmsm_dis.c, broken up the function QMsm_dispatch() into two functions QMsm_dispatch_() and QMsm_tran_(). This has reduced the cyclomatic complexity from 15 for the original function, to 9 and 7 for QMsm_dispatch_() and QMsm_tran_(), respectively.</li>
<li>In file <a class="el" href="qf__act_8c.html">qf_act.c</a> added the function QF_bzero(), and in files qvanilla.c and <a class="el" href="qk_8c.html">qk.c</a> added calls to QF_bzero() to explicitly clear the uninitialized data. Also added calls to QF_bzero() inside qf_psini.c.</li>

Version 5.1.1, 2013-10-10</h1>
<p>This release fixes reversal of logic in the QF_noTimeEvtsActiveX() function as well as sleep mode transition in the ARM Cortex-M3/M4 ports to the cooperative Vanilla kernel. Also, the native QP event queue implementation has been changed to count the extra "front-event" location into the number of free entries, which fixes the problem of defer queues of depth 1. Finally, the release restores the support for linting (with PC-Lint) of the QP/C applications for ARM Cortex-M (with IAR and GNU compilers).</p>

Version 5.1.0, 2013-09-23</h1>
<p>This release brings significant improvements to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing implementation and also brings important changes the ARM Cortex-M port.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd><b>QP/C 5.1.0 requires changing the interrupt priority setting in the existing ARM Cortex-M applications</b>. Specifically, you need to set the interrupt priorities equal or lower than <b>QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI</b> constant provided in the qf_port.h header file.</dd></dl>
<p>Changes to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing component in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Optimized the internal <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> implementation of all functions that insert trace data into the trace buffer. The general idea of the optimization is to extensively use automatic variables instead of global variables (such as buffer head and tail indexes, the running checksum, etc.). For the modern CPUs (such as ARM) this resulting machine code performs most operations in registers, instead of constantly updating the memory through the expensive load/store instructions. The time savings through avoiding load/store instructions are significant, even after taking the performance hit from loading the registers from the globals in the beginning of each function and storing the final register values into the globals at the end.</li>
<li>Reduced the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> code size by using loops instead of unrolled-loops as before. This reduced the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> component size from over 4KB to 1.7KB (for ARM Cortex-M3/M4, IAR compiler).</li>
<li>Modified the make scripts for building QP libraries to use higher-level optimization for the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing functions in the SPY build configuration. This brings additional 20-50% speed improvement, depending on the compiler and optimization options used. Please note that only the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> component is built with high-optimization. The QEP, <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> components in the SPY configuration are still built with low-optimization level, so that the application can be conveniently debugged.</li>
<li>Reduced the number of <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> global filters from 256 to 124 (0x7C). This enables the code to avoid escaping the trace record numbers (because they cannot overlap the special flag byte 0x7E or the escape byte 0x7D) and also speeds up the QS_filterOff(QS_ALL_RECORDS) function, which is useful for stopping the trace quickly to avoid overwriting some interesting data with the new data.</li>
<li>An empty <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> record and the QS_RESET record are now inserted automatically into the trace buffer in the function QS_initBuf(). The empty <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> record/QS_RESET pair provides a clean start of a session and allows the QSPY host application to re-synch with the data stream, even if the last <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> record of a previous session is incomplete. This ability is very helpful for re-setting the target while collecting a trace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, lab tests for ARM Cortex-M4 with the IAR compiler show that the processing time of the QS_u32_() function (the one frequently used to store pointers and timestamps) dropped from 233 CPU cycles for QP 5.0 with low-level optimization to just 76 cycles for QP 5.1 with high-level of optimization. At the same time, the code size of this function dropped from 876 bytes to 274 bytes.</p>
<p>Changes to the QP ports to ARM Cortex-M in detail:</p>
<p>QP 5.1.0 never completely disables interrupts in the ARM Cortex-M3/M4 cores, even inside the critical sections. On Cortex-M3/M4 (ARMv7-M architectures), the QP port disables interrupts selectively using the BASEPRI register. (NOTE: The BASEPRI register is not implemented in the ARMv6-M architecture (Cortex-M0/M0+), so Cortex-M0/M0+ need to use the PRIMASK register to disable interrupts globally).</p>
<p>This new policy of disabling interrupts divides interrupts into "kernel-unaware" interrupts, which are never disabled, and "kernel-aware" interrupts, which are disabled in the QP critical sections. Only "kernel-aware" interrupts are allowed to call QP services. "Kernel-unaware" interrupts are <em>NOT</em> allowed to call any QP services and they can communicate with QP only by triggering a "kernel-aware" interrupt (which can post or publish events).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, all QP ports to ARM Cortex-M included in the QP 5.1.0 Baseline Code provide the constant QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI, which must be used to offset the "kernel-aware" interrupt priorities.</p>
<p>All example projects for ARM Cortex-M included in the QP 5.1.0 Baseline Code demonstrate the recommended way of assigning interrupt priorities in your applications. The initialization consist of two steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>you enumerate the "kernel-unaware" and "kernel-aware" interrupt priorities (whereas you offset the "kernel-aware" priorities by the constant QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI) and</li>
<li>you assign the priorities to <em>ALL</em> interrupts by calling the NVIC_SetPriority() CMSIS function.</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Leaving the interrupt priority at the default value of zero (the highest priority) is most likely <b>incorrect</b>, because the "kernel-unaware" interrupts <b>cannot</b> call any QP services.</dd></dl>
<p>For more information, please read the short Application Note "Setting
ARM Cortex-M Interrupt Priorities in QP 5.1" available at: <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_ARM-Cortex-M_Interrupt-Priorities.pdf">https://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_ARM-Cortex-M_Interrupt-Priorities.pdf</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_5_0_0"></a>
Version 5.0.0, 2013-09-10</h1>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>QP/C 5.0.0 remains <b>backwards-compatible</b> with the existing QP/C 4.x applications.</dd></dl>
<p>The main purpose of this milestone QP/C release is to enable the QM modeling tool to generate a new type of state machine code (requires QM version 3.0.0, which is still in development as of this writing).</p>
<p>This new type of state machine implementation in QP/C 5 is based on the new <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> class, which takes advantage of the QM tool as an advanced "state machine compiler". QM can perform optimizations that were not possible with the C pre-processor alone. Specifically, the QM can easily determine the LCA (Least-Common-Ancestor) state for every transition and it can generate the complete transition-sequences (sequences of exit/entry/initial actions) at code-generation time. The resulting code can be still highly human-readable, but it will no longer be human-maintainable. The lab tests indicate that the new "housekeeping" code for executing hierarchical state machines can be about twice as fast as the previous code based on the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> class. Additionally, the new code requires less run-time support (smaller event processor) and uses 70% less of stack space in the call to the QMsm_dispatch() operation than QHsm_dispatch().</p>
<p>The next big feature introduced in QP/C 5 is polymorphism ("virtual" functions) for basic operations, such as state machine init() and dispatch() and active object start(), post(), and postLIFO() perations. Making these functions "virtual" means that all these operations can be re-defined in sub-classes of state machines and active objects. This, in turn, allows a single application to use a mix of state machine classes derived from the new <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> base class with state machines derived from the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> base class, each one using a different state machine implementation strategy. Additionally, the virtual post() operation could be very useful for implementing various Proxy active objects (e.g., for active object event posting across networks).</p>
<p>Another big feature introduced in QP/C 5 are the multiple, independent system clock tick rates for time events. The number of system tick rates can be now configured in the QP/C ports. For example, a digital watch can use a "fast" clock tick rate of 100Hz and a "slow" clock tick rate of only 1Hz. These clock tick rates can be managed independently, so for example, the fast clock tick rate can be shut down in the absence of time events assigned to this rate. This feature allows the applications to implement sophisticated power-saving policies.</p>
<p>As yet another important feature, QP/C adds a new "extended" API for non-asserting event allocation and posting. This feature is intended for situations, where an application is hammered with external events that at times arrive too fast for processing, but that can be ignored under the overload conditions. In those cases firing an assertion inside the framework is undesirable. The non-asserting API allows a designer to request a safety-margin when allocating or posting an event. The event is not allocated/posted if the safety margin cannot be satisfied at the time of the call. On the other hand, the safety margin allows the application to still use the regular (asserting) event allocation and posting, because the event pools and event queues are guaranteed to maintain a minimal margin for safe operation.</p>
<p>Finally, QP/C adds a number of smaller features and improvements, summarized in the following detailed list of changes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Added the new <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> "class" to qep.h. Changed the inheritance tree by deriving <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> and QFsm from the <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> base class. Added virtual table structures for <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a>, and QFsm (polymorphism).<ul>
<li>added macro <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a8356802b7936cf2b3eafba6f82fdf53f">QMSM_INIT()</a> to polymorphically call the state machine initialization implementation in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_msm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QMsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QMsm</a> base class and all subclasses.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new source files qmsm_ini.c and qmsm_dis.c to the QEP. These files implement the QMsm_init() and QMsm_dispatch() functions, respectively.</li>
<li>Added the new "QMActive" "class" to qf.h. Extended the inheritance tree to derive <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> from <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a>. Added virtual table structures for <a class="el" href="struct_q_m_active.html" title="Active object class (based on QMsm implementation strategy)">QMActive</a> and QActvie (polymorphism).<ul>
<li>modified macro <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ab7c56990d949c8708e3fe2b737f2e65c">QACTIVE_POST()</a> to polymorphically call the direct event posting to an active object.</li>

This macro is to be defined in the <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> ports (in the qf_port.h header file). If the macro is undefined, the default value is 1 (one clock tick rate).</li>
<li>renamed and re-implemented the QF_tick() function as the "extended" QF_tickX() function with the argument 'tickRate' for processing time events allocated to different clock rates. The application must call QF_tickX(0), QF_tickX(1), ~~~ at the specified tick rates from ISRs or <em>tasks</em>.</li>
<li>added an "extended" time event constructor QTimeEvt_ctorX(), which assigns a time event to a specific tick rate as well as specific active object.</li>
<li>renamed and re-implemented the internal function QTimeEvt_arm_() to a public function QTimeEvt_armX() for arming time events initialized with the "extended" constructor. The QTimeEvt_armX() function is the new recommended API for arming time events, both one-shot and periodic.</li>
<li>re-implemented QTimeEvt_disarm() and QTimeEvt_rarm().</li>
<li>renamed QF_noTimeEvtsActive() to the "extended" version QF_noTimeEvtsActiveX(), which checks time events assigned to the given tick rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the new non-asserting API to qf.h:<ul>
<li>renamed internal function QF_new_() to QF_newX_(), the latter one taking the argument 'margin' for allocating events. The function returns NULL if the event pool has less free events than the specified margin. The function asserts if the margin is zero and the event can't be allocated.</li>
<li>added function QActive_post() to post an event to the given active object. The function does not post the event if the target event queue has less free slots than the specified margin. The function asserts if the margin is zero and the event can't be posted.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Modified the QActive_defer() function to return the status of the defer operation (true==success), instead of asserting when the defer queue overflows.</li>
<li>Modified <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> (Quantum Spy) software tracing implementation:<ul>

Changed the macros QS_*_DICTIONARY() to call these functions. This was done to significantly reduce the amount of tracing code needed to send the dictionaries from applications.</li>
<li>grouped together the various <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> variables (such as filters, trace buffer indexes, etc.) in a single struct, which results in a more efficient code for various <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the structure of the ARM Cortex-M ports<ul>
<li>renamed the sub-directory for ARM Cortex-M ports and examples from "arm-cortex" to "arm-cm". This is done to avoid confusion with other ARM Cortex variants, such as Cortex-A/R, which very different from Cortex-M.</li>

Version 4.5.03, Nov 27, 2012</h1>
<p>This release changes the directory structure of QP ports to various operating systems, such as POSIX (Linux, BSD, etc.), Win32 (Windows), Qt, etc. The OS ports are moved from the ports/80x86/ directory one level up to ports/. Also, the OS examples are moved from the examples/80x86/ directory one level up to examples/.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_5_02"></a>
Version 4.5.02, Aug 04, 2012</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is better, more comprehensive support for (rapid) prototyping of embedded QP applications on the desktop with the Win32 API and with Qt. Among others, this release adds a complete toolkit for creating realistic embedded front panels with pure Win32-GUI API and free Visual C++ Express and ResEdit. An extensive Application Note "QP and Win32" is included in this release.</p>
<p>This release simplifies the QP ports to desktop OSs, such as Windows (Win32), Linux, BSD, Mac OSX (POSIX) and combines 32-bit and 64-bit ports in one with conditional compilation.</p>
<p>This release also adds an option for using constructors for dynamically allocated events. When the configuration macro Q_EVT_CTOR is defined, the <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a85513d80fc73d015efff2596428e4703">Q_NEW()</a> macro becomes variadic and takes the arguments for the event constructor. This generally allows creating dynamic events "on-the-fly" without a temporary pointer to the event. This QP configuration is demonstrated only in the QP port to Qt, but can be used in any other port.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The event constructor feature is NOT backward-compatible with the existing applications.</dd></dl>
<p>This release also adds a new macro QF_MPOOL_EL, which is intended for allocating properly aligned storage for memory pools and event pools.</p>
<p>All QP ports included in this release use only a single QP library, rather than separate libraries for QEP, <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this release adds QM models, created with the new QM 2.2.00 to most of the examples. The code generated by this new QM version complies with MISRA-C:2004 rules.</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modified QP port to Win32 and used the free Visual C++ Express 2010 with Platform SDK rather than Visual C++ Pro 2008. Renamed the port directory from vc2008/ to vc/. Provided a completely revised App Note "QP and Win32".</li>
<li>Eliminated QP port to Win32 with one thread (Win32-1T).</li>
<li>Consolidated all QP ports to POSIX OSs (Linux, Linux64, Mac_OSX) into a single port to POSIX and placed it in the directory posix/.</li>
<li>Renamed the port directory qt_1t/ to qt/.</li>
<li>Added event constructor to qevt.h (controlled by the configuration macro Q_EVT_CTOR).</li>
<li>Added new variadic version of the <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a85513d80fc73d015efff2596428e4703">Q_NEW()</a> macro in qf.h when Q_EVT_CTOR is defined.</li>
<li>Added macro QF_MPOOL_EL to <a class="el" href="qmpool_8h.html" title="QP native, platform-independent memory pool QMPool interface.">qmpool.h</a>. Modified all examples to demonstrate the use of this macro to allocate properly aligned storage for event pools.</li>
<li>Added new typedef 'enum_t' and modified signatures of functions taking event signals from QSignal to enum_t. This was done to significantly reduce the number of casts necessary when enumerated signals were passed to QP functions.</li>
<li>Modified all QP ports distributed in the QP/C baseline code to generate only a single QP library, rather than separate libraries for QEP, <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a>, <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a>, and <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a>. This includes all QP ports to the desktop (ports/80x86/ directory) and ARM Cortex-M ports (ports/arm-cortex/ directory).</li>
<li>Modified all examples to link only one QP library.</li>
<li>Added QM models to most examples and used the automatically generated code from the models instead of the hand-written code.</li>
<li>Modified Qt ports to use the new "event constructors" and modified examples for Qt to demonstrate this feature.</li>
<li>Added .ui files to the Qt examples for generating UIs graphically with the Qt Designer tool. Revised and updated the App Note "QP and Qt".</li>
<li>Added new macro <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#ae75893daa66c6d0b5a6dfb8f3fca1196">QS_USR_DICTIONARY()</a> to <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> for providing symbolic names for user-defined trace records</li>
<li>Added new macro QS_RESET() to <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> for telling the QSPY application when the target resets. This allows QSPY to reset its internal state.</li>

Version 4.5.01, Jun 14, 2012</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this minor release is providing improved MISRA-compliant state machine implementation. Specifically, a new macro <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a40a035a3e4679f8b35d81a7f49a6d44f">Q_UNHANDLED()</a> has been added for a situation when a guard condition evaluates to FALSE, but the state model does not prescribe the explicit [else] case for this guard. In this case, the state handler can return <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a40a035a3e4679f8b35d81a7f49a6d44f">Q_UNHANDLED()</a>, which will cause the QEP event processor to propagate the event to the superstate, which is what UML semantics prescribes.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>These change to the QEP event processor is completely backwards-compatible. All state handler functions coded the old way will continue to handle the guard conditions correctly and in accordance with the UML specification. The new <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a40a035a3e4679f8b35d81a7f49a6d44f">Q_UNHANDLED()</a> macro is necessary only for MISRA-compliant state handler coding, which will be applied in the upcoming release of the QM modeling and code generation tool.</dd></dl>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Added macro <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a40a035a3e4679f8b35d81a7f49a6d44f">Q_UNHANDLED()</a> and return value Q_RET_UNHANDLED in qep.h.</li>
<li>Modified qhsm_dis.c to handle the Q_RET_UNHANDLED return value.</li>
<li>Updated the QP/C MISRA-C:2004 compliance matrix to include the new MISRA-compliant way of coding guard conditions.</li>
<li>Modified <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a> and qs_dummy.h to add new trace record type QS_QEP_UNHANDLED, which is generated when the state handler returns Q_RET_UNHANDLED.</li>
<li>Modified <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a> and qs_dummy.h to add the User record dictionary trace record and macro <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html#ae75893daa66c6d0b5a6dfb8f3fca1196">QS_USR_DICTIONARY()</a>.</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This new trace record requires the updated QSPY 4.5.01.</dd></dl>
<ol type="1">
<li>Corrected qfsm_dis.c, which did not generate <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace records for entry and exit from non-hierarchical states.</li>
<li>Updated the IAR ARM compiler used in the ARM Cortex-M examples to the latest version IAR EWARM 6.40.</li>
<li>Modified the Qt port not to define the QPApp::onClockTick() slot function, but instead to allow defining this slot function in the BSP of the application.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_5_00"></a>
Version 4.5.00, May 29, 2012</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to improve host-based development of QP applications, which is critical for Test-Driven Development (TDD). Among others, this release provides integration between QP and the popular Qt GUI framework, which allows developers to easily build host-based simulations of the embedded systems with the realistic user interfaces.</p>
<p>This realase also simplifies implementing transitions to history, which is a preparation to providing this feature in the QM modeling tool.</p>
<p>Changes in detail:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Renamed the event class from QEvent to <a class="el" href="struct_q_evt.html" title="Event class.">QEvt</a> to avoid a name conflict with the Qt framework. Also, for consistency, renamed the file qevent.h to qevt.h and the macro Q_EVENT_CAST() to <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a9f117cb1bc50e9ef4dcc933533ccdd7f">Q_EVT_CAST()</a>.</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>To minimize impact of this change on the existing QP ports and applications, the name QEvent is provided as well, but this can be suppressed by defining the configuration macro Q_NQEVENT in qep_port.h.</dd></dl>
<ol type="1">
<li>Changed the design of QF_tick() (file qf_tick.c) to better support calling this function from low-priority tasks (as opposed to interrupts and highest-priority tasks), which often happens when QP is executed on the desktop operating systems. In this design only QF_tick() can remove time events from the active linked list, so no unexpected changes to the list structure are eliminated.</li>
<li>Simplified the <a class="el" href="struct_q_time_evt.html" title="Time Event class.">QTimeEvt</a> class by removing the 'prev' link pointer, as the new design no longer needs a bi-directional list. These changes impact the files: qte_*.c.</li>
<li>Added return value to <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html#a779a1bc9482e2d489dc87751cd100fdb">QF_run()</a> to allow transfer of the exit status to the desktop operating systems.</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This modification haves impact on most QP/C ports, because the <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html#a779a1bc9482e2d489dc87751cd100fdb">QF_run()</a> function must now return a int16_t value.</dd></dl>
<ol type="1">
<li>Eliminated the 'running' member of the <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html" title="Active object class (based on the QHsm implementation strategy)">QActive</a> class, which has been used only in the QP ports to "big" OSes such as Linux or Windows.</li>
<li>Added member 'temp' to the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> and QFsm base classes to prevent clobbering the current state (the 'state' member) during transitions. This change allows keeping the current state unchanged during the entire transition chain, which in turn allows easy and generic access to the state information to store the state history in the exit actions from states. Additional bonus of this re-design is the opportunity of testing for stable state configuration in assertions added to the qhsm_*.c and qfsm_*.c files.</li>
<li>Added the QHsm_state() and QFsm_state() accessor macros.</li>
<li>Modified the "Transition to History" pattern implementation to use the simplified technique of obtaining the current state in the exit action from the superstate rather than all the exit actions from the substates. Modified the "State-Local Storage" (SLS) pattern as well, because it was using the transition to history constructs.</li>
<li>Re-designed the implementation of the QSPY host application, so that it can be convenienty included as part of the QP library. This allows direct <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> tracing output to the screen for QP applications running on the desktop.</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This change is part of the Qtools release 4.5.00.</dd></dl>
<ol type="1">
<li>Modified the QP ports to Win32_1t (both the MinGW and VC2008) to output <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> trace data directly to the stdout via the QSPY host-application interface.

<li>Added QP port to Qt_1t (Qt with one thread) and two example applications (DPP and PELICAN crossing).</li>
<li>Added GNU compiler option -pthread to QP ports for POSIX with P-threads, including QP ports and examples for Linux and Mac OS X.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Moved QS_SIG_() definition from qep.h to <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a></li>

</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This modifications have impact on most QP/C ports, because the <a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html" title="Sample QP/C port.">qp_port.h</a> header file must be removed from the port.</dd></dl>

The bug fix addresses a very rare and undocumented behavior of late-arrival of an interrupt while entering the PendSV exception. In this case the PENDSVSET bit in the NVIC-ICSR register is <em>not</em> cleared when finally PendSV is entered, so the PendSV exception is entered in a <em>different</em> state when it is entered via the late-arrival mechanism versus the normal activation of the exception through tail-chaining. The consequence of this undocumented and inconsistent hardware behavior, PendSV could be re-entered again before the SVCall exception cleans up the stack. The bug fix is implemented in the qk_port.s file and consists of clearing the PENDSVSET bit programmatically inside PendSV_Handler.</p>

<li>The main purpose of this release is to repackage the default QP/C distribution to contain the single root directory <code>qpc/</code> in the archive. That way, unziping the archive will produce only one directory (<code>qpc/</code>), which can be then changed by the user.</li>
<li>This release also changes the ARM Cortex QP ports with GNU. The suffix "_cs" has been added to all QP libraries generated by the Code Sourcery toolset (now Mentor Sourcery CodeBench).

Version 4.2.00, Jul 14, 2011</h1>
<p>The goal of this milestone release is to extend the number of event pools (theoretically up to 255 pools) instead of just three event pools available up til now. Also, this release adds several improvements to the QS/QSPY software tracing, such as adding sender information to event posting so that sequence diagrams could be easily and automatically reconstructed from tracing data. Also, the tracing now supports 64-bit targets, such as embedded Linux 64-bit. Finally, this milestone release migrates the examples to use the environment variable QPC instead of relying on the relative path to the QP/C framework. This allows easier adaptation of the examples for real projects, which don't really belong to the examples directory.</p>
<p>The changes in detail are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Changed the QEvent base struct (file qevent.h). The private member 'dynamic_' has been replaced by two members 'poolId_' and 'refCtr_'.</li>
<li>Added configuration macro QF_MAX_EPOOL (file qf.h) to define the maximum number of event pools in the QP application (default to 3). The maximum theoretical number of this macro is 255.</li>
<li>Made algorithmic changes in the <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> source code related to the change of storing the event pool-IDs and reference counters inside QEvent.</li>
<li>Changed the default signal size (macro Q_SIGNAL_SIZE in the file qevent.h) from 1 to 2 bytes.</li>
<li>Changed the signature of QActive_recall() to return uint8_t instead of QEvent*, which this could encourage incorrect usage (processing of the event at the point of recalling it). Now, the function only returns 1 (TRUE) if the event was recalled and 0 (FALSE) if the event was not recalled.</li>
<li>Added the function QTimeEvt_ctr() and new source file qte_ctr.c. The function returns the counter of a time event, which allows using a time event for measuring the time.</li>
<li>Added new <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a095356f76aa32cb738325abfa55e96fc">QF_TICK</a>, <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#afd57334f2a1664a168b0702a106e0782">QF_PUBLISH</a>, and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ab7c56990d949c8708e3fe2b737f2e65c">QACTIVE_POST</a> in file qf.h to provide sender of the events for software tracing.</li>
<li>Added new <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> macros (files <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a> and qs_dummy.h) for handling 64-bit integers.</li>
<li>Added the functions QS_u64() and QS_u64_() and new source file qs_u64.c.</li>
<li>Added the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> macro #QS_U32_HEX_T for hexadecimal formatting of integer numbers in the user-defined trace records.</li>
<li>Added the new port linux64 for 64-bit Linux. Also added the corresponding examples for 64-bit Linux.</li>
<li>Adapted the QSPY host application for 64-bit pointer sizes and the changed layout of trace records that contain event information (such as PoolID and RefCtr). Also added the backwards-compatibility option (-v) for switching the tool to the previous data format.</li>
<li>Removed the tools directory from the QPC distribution and moved the QSPY host application to the QTOOLS distribution, which now also contains the GNU make tools for Windows.</li>

Version 4.1.07, Feb 28, 2011</h1>
<p>The goal of this release is to improve the ease of experimenting with QP/C on the desktop. This release adds support for Windows (Win32) to the baseline code. Two most popular compilers for Windows are supported: Microsoft Visual Studio and MinGW (GNU). The support for Linux has been improved by including pre-built QP/C libraries and improving makefiles for Eclipse compatibility.</p>
<p>The changes in detail are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Added Win32 port with the Visual C++ 2008 (ports/80x86/win32/vc2008). This directory contains the Visual Studio solution all_qp.sln for building all QP/C libraries from the IDE. Three build configurations (Debug, Release, and Spy) are supported.</li>
<li>Added Win32 port with the MinGW compiler (ports/80x86/win32/mingw). This directory contains the Makefile for building all QP/C libraries. Three build configurations (dbg, rel, and spy) are supported.</li>
</ol>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>the Makefile assumes that the MinGW/bin directory is added to the PATH.</dd></dl>
<ol type="1">
<li>Added Win32 examples for Visual C++ 2008 (examples/80x86/win32/ vc2008/dpp and examples/80x86/win32/vc2008/qhsmtst). Visual Studio solutions are provides for all build configurations.</li>
<li>Added Win32 examples for MinGW (examples/80x86/win32/mingw/dpp and examples/80x86/win32/mingw/qhsmtst). Eclipse-compatible makefiles are provided for all build configurations. NOTE: the Makefiles assume that the MinGW/bin directory is added to the PATH.</li>
<li>Removed memory alignment correction in the file qmp_init.c. This correction required casting of pointers to integers and was problematic on 64-bit targets (such as 64-bit Linux).</li>
<li>Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with CodeSourcery to the latest Sourcery G++ 2011.02-2.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_06"></a>
Version 4.1.06, Jan 07, 2011</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Made cosmetic improvements to the example QM models of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game.</li>
<li>Made improvements in make.bat files for building the examples for DOS/Open Watcom to run better in DosBox on Linux.</li>
<li>Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with IAR to the latest IAR EWARM version 6.10.</li>
<li>Upgraded the examples for ARM Cortex with CodeSourcery to the latest Sourcery G++ 2010.09-66.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_05"></a>
Version 4.1.05, Nov 01, 2010</h1>
<p>This release is adds examples for the QM (QP Modeler) graphical modeling and code generation tool. The examples are based on the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game described in the QP/C Tutorial and in Chapter 1 of the PSiCC2 book.</p>
<p>Specifically, the directory &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/game-qm/ contains the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game model file "game.qm". This model, when opened in the QM tool contains all state machine diagrams and generates code into the subdirectory qm_code/. This code can then be built and executed on any 80x86 machine (newer versions of Windows or Linux require the DOSbox application, see <a href="http://www.dosbox.com">http://www.dosbox.com</a>).</p>
<p>The directory &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/arm-cortex/vanilla/iar/game-ev-lm3s811-qm/ contains the version of the game for the EV-LM3S811 ARM Cortex-M3 board. This directory contains the model file "game.qm", which is actually identical as the model in the DOS version. The LM3S811 version needs to be compiled with the IAR compiler and executed on the EV-LM3S811 board.</p>
<p>Additionally, the QP/C baseline code has been slightly modified for better conformance to the MISRA C 2004 rules and the latest PC-Lint 9.x.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_04"></a>
Version 4.1.04, Mar 16, 2010</h1>
<p>This release is adds compatibility of all examples for DOS with the DOSBox emulator (<a href="http://www.dosbox.com">http://www.dosbox.com</a>) that recreates a MS-DOS compatible environment on all versions of Windows, including 64-bit Windows that don't run 16-bit DOS applications anymore.</p>
<p>Also, this release includes QP ports and examples for EV-LM3S811 board with the GNU-based Code Sourcery G++ toolset. Support for Sourcery G++ provides a very cost-effective option for developing QP applications for ARM Cortex MCUs.</p>
<p>Finally, this release improves the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) for the whole family of the Stellaris LM3Sxxx MCUs. The improvement extends the CMSIS from Sandstorm to Fury, DustDevil, and Tempest Stellaris families.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_03"></a>
Version 4.1.03, Jan 21, 2010</h1>
<p>This release is concerned with the ARM Cortex ports and examples. Specifically, this release contains the following improvements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unified source code for ARM Cortex-M3 and the new ARM Cortex-M0 cores, including the code for the preemptive <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> kernel.</li>
<li>Compliance with the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) in all ARM Cortex examples.</li>
<li>Backward-compatible support for the new LM3S811 EVAL Rev C board with different OLED display than previous revisions. (NOTE: The OSRAM 96x16x1 OLED used in REV A-B boards has been replaced RITEK 96x16x1 OLED used in Rev C.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the process of making the examples CMSIS-compliant, the dependency on the Luminary Micro driver library (driverlib.a) has been completely removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the screen saver of the "Fly 'n' Shoot" game has been improved to periodically switch off the power of the OLED display, which better protects the display from burn-in. The affected file is tunnel.c.</p>
<p>Finally, this release introduces the QP_VERSION macro, which identifies the QP version. Otherwise, this maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications except for the ARM Cortex ports and applications.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_02"></a>
Version 4.1.02, Jan 14, 2010</h1>
<p>The purpose of this minor maintenance release is the change in the directory structure for the ARM Cortex ports and examples. As new ARM Cortex cores are becoming available, the old port name "cortex-m3" could be misleading, because it actually applies to wider range of ARM Cortex cores. Consequently, all ARM Cortex ports and examples are hosted in the directory tree called "arm-cortex".</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications except for the ARM Cortex ports and applications.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_01"></a>
Version 4.1.01, Nov 05, 2009</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to replace the Turbo C++ 1.01 toolset with the Open Watcom C/C++ toolset, because Turbo C++ 1.01 is no longer available for a free download. In contrast, Open Watcom is distributed under an OSI-certified open source license, which permits free commercial and non-commercial use. Open Watcom can be downloaded from www.openwatcom.org.</p>
<p>All 80x86/DOS, 80x86/qk, and 80x86/ucos2 ports and examples for Turbo C++ 1.01 have been replaced with ports and examples for Open Watcom. The make.bat scripts are provided to build the QP/C libraries and examples.</p>
<p>In the process of converting the examples to Open Watcom two new examples have been added to the standard QP/C distribution. The Calc2 example located in &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/calc2 shows how to derive state machine classes with QP 4.x. The SLS example located in &lt;qpc&gt;/examples/80x86/dos/watcom/l/sls shows the implementation of the new State-Local Storage state design pattern.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_1_00"></a>
Version 4.1.00, Oct 09, 2009</h1>
<p>The release brings a number of improvements to QP/C and updates the QP/C ARM Cortex-M3 examples for the EK-LM3S811 board to the latest IAR EWARM 5.40.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.1.00 with respect to earlier versions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qs_8h.html" title="QS/C platform-independent public interface.">qs.h</a> added a new trace record QS_QEP_DISPATCH logged when an event is dispatched to a state machine. This timestamped trace record marks the beginning of an RTC step. The end of the RTC step is marked by the existing timestamped trace records QS_QEP_INTERN_TRAN, QS_QEP_INIT_TRAN, and QS_QEP_IGNORED, depending on how the event is handled. The new QS_QEP_DISPATCH record facilitates measurement of the RTC step lengths.</li>
<li>in qhsm_dis.c added generation of the QS_QEP_DISPATCH trace record.</li>
<li>in the tools/qspy/ sub-directory added output of the new trace record to the Q-SPY host application.</li>
<li>in the tools/qspy/matlab/ sub-directory added processing of the new trace record to the qspy.m script.</li>
<li>in qpset.h changed the implementation of the Priority Set. In particular, the QPSet64 now derives from QPSet8, which enables a common way of testing for non-empty set (e.g., useful in assembly). Also, the findMax() functions in QPSet8 and QPSet64 now can work with an empty set, in which case they return 0.</li>
<li>in qk_sched.c simplified the QK_schedule_() function to skip the testing of the ready-set for non-empty condition. Such test is no longer necessary. The test can still be performed outside the QK_schedule_() function (e.g., in assembly) to avoid calling the scheduler if the ready set is empty.</li>
<li>in qk_ext.c simplified the QK_scheduleExt_() function in the same way as QK_schedule_().</li>
<li>modified make.bat files for building QP libraries in the ports/ directory to use the externally defined environment variables for the location of the toolchains. The defaults are applied only when the environment variable is not defined. This enables greater flexibility in installing the development tools in different directories than those chosen by Quantum Leaps.</li>
<li>modified the ARM Cortex-M3 examples for the new IAR EWARM 5.40.</li>
<li>modified slightly the Calculator example to allow extensibility.</li>
<li>in the ARM Cortex-M3 port file qk_port.s added explicit testing of the QF_readySet_ set for empty condition. This test allows avoiding calling the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> scheduler and two contex-switches if the ready-set is empty.</li>
<li>in the game example moved setting up the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> filters from main.c to bsp.c.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_04"></a>
Version 4.0.04, Apr 09, 2009</h1>
<p>The maintenance release provides a fix for the compile-time assertions, which did not work correctly for the GNU compiler family. Also, the ARM Cortex-M3 examples have been recompiled with the newer IAR EWARM v5.30.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0.04 with respect to earlier version are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in qassert.h file the <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a753a7ea8d4943b60d5d96a843a535288">Q_ASSERT_COMPILE</a> macro has been modified to render a negative array dimension when the asserted condition is not TRUE.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_03"></a>
Version 4.0.03, Dec 27, 2008</h1>
<p>The main purpose of this release is to fix a bug in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> preemptive kernel, which occurs only when the advanced <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> features are used. Specifically, the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> priority-ceiling mutex could interfere with <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> thread-local storage (TLS) or <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> extended context switch. When the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> mutex is in use, the TLS or the extended context for this task could get saved to an incorrect priority level.</p>
<p>The release 4.0.03 fixes the bug by strictly preserving the semantics of QK_currPrio_ variable. The mutex locking now uses a different variable QK_ceilingPrio_, which represents the ceiling-priority locked by the mutex. The <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> scheduler and extended scheduler now perform an additional check to make sure that only tasks with priorities above the ceiling can run. To avoid that additional overhead, the user can define the macro QK_NO_MUTEX, which eliminates the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> mutex API and eliminates the additional tests in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> schedulers.</p>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0.03 with respect to earlier version are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a class="el" href="qk_8h.html" title="QK/C (preemptive non-blocking kernel) platform-independent public interface.">qk.h</a> file made the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> mutex API only visible when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is <em>not</em> defined.</li>
<li>in qk_pkg.h file, added the QK_ceilingPrio_ external declaration when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.</li>
<li>in qk_mutex.c file, changed priority-ceiling mutex implementation to use the QK_ceilingPrio_ instead of QK_currPrio_. Also, added compiler error when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is definedthis and this file is included in the build.</li>
<li>in qk_sched.c file added testing priority against the QK_ceilingPrio_, when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.</li>
<li>in qk_ext.c file added testing priority against the QK_ceilingPrio_, when the macro QK_NO_MUTEX is not defined.</li>
</ul>

Version 4.0.02, Nov 15, 2008</h1>
<p>This maintenance release does not change the QP/C API in any way, so the release has NO IMPACT on the QP/C applications.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0.02 with respect to earlier version are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>in qep.h file, added comments to macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a8f06cd90ba5060780fc61a4810e3eb50">Q_TRAN()</a> and <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ad8abd2f7098c41ec464343d9d8f1eadc">Q_SUPER()</a> to suppress the PC-lint warning about using the comma-operator (MISRA rule 42).</li>
<li>in qhsm_in.c file, fixed a bug in the <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#aa27c703df6d2f8c1b1c334b45d8381fe">QHsm_isIn()</a> function.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_01"></a>
Version 4.0.01, June 09, 2008</h1>
<p>This maintenance release is made to allow using <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing with the GNU compiler for AVR (WinAVR). Specifically, the output of the strings residing in ROM has been fixed.</p>

</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="qpc_4_0_00"></a>
Version 4.0.00, Apr 07, 2008</h1>
<p>This milestone release is made for the book /ref PSiCC2. The book describes in great detail this new release. The older "QP Programmer's Manual" is now phased out and is replaced with this hyper-linked /ref main_page "QP/C Reference Manual", which provides very detailed, easily searchable reference to the software. The book /ref PSiCC2 provides in-depth discussion of the relevant concepts as well as the design study of QP v4.0.</p>
<p>The main changes in QP v4.0 with respect to earlier versions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>the coding techniques for hierarchical state machines (HSMs) and the simpler finite state machines (FSMs) have changed. While the changes are quite simple, the backward compatibility with QEP 3.x has been broken, meaning that some manual changes to the state machines implemented with earlier versions are necessary. Please refer to the "QP/C Tutorial" Section /ref coding_hsm for more information about coding state machines with QEP 4.x.<ul>
<li>The main change is the signature of a state-handler function, which now returns simply a byte. This return type (typedef'ed as QState) is the status of the event-handling that the state handler conveys to the QEP event processor.</li>
<li>The macro <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a8f06cd90ba5060780fc61a4810e3eb50">Q_TRAN()</a> must now always follow the return statement.</li>
<li>The new macro <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#ad8abd2f7098c41ec464343d9d8f1eadc">Q_SUPER()</a> designates the superstate of the given state. Again, this macro must follow the return statement.</li>
<li>Then two new macros <a class="el" href="qp_8h.html#a54b2da5e70ef983cfa7ca74deac237a3">Q_HANDLED()</a> and #Q_IGNORED() have been added to return the status of event handled and event ignored, respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all callback functions are now consistently called /c #XXX_onYYY():<ul>
<li>Q_assert_handler() is now <a class="el" href="qpc_8h.html#a3aa0e957af9cc6386258fd0b173d38a6">Q_onAssert()</a></li>
<li>QF_start() is now QF_onStartup()</li>
<li>QF_cleanup() is now QF_onCleanup()</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the new header file qevent.h has been broken off the qep.h header file. qevent.h contains the QEvent class and other basic facilities used in the whole QP. This new file allows easier replacement of the entire QEP event processor with custom event processors, if you wish do so.</li>
<li>the macro QEP_SIGNAL_SIZE is renamed to <a class="el" href="qp__config_8h.html#afdaa94c40e947b0340b4259eddce3561">Q_SIGNAL_SIZE</a>.</li>
<li>the data type QSTATE is now deprecated. Please use QState.</li>
<li>the "protected" in C don't no longer have the trailing underscore. For example, QHsm_ctor_() is replaced with #QHsm_ctor(), etc.</li>
<li>the QF_FSM_ACTIVE macro is now deprecated. Instead, you have the family of macros QF_ACTIVE_SUPER_, QF_ACTIVE_CTOR_, QF_ACTIVE_INIT_, QF_ACTIVE_DISPATCH_, QF_ACTIVE_STATE_, which allow replacing the base class for active objects in <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a>. By default, these macros are defined to use the <a class="el" href="struct_q_hsm.html" title="Hierarchical State Machine class (QHsm-style state machine implementation strategy)">QHsm</a> class from the QEP hierarchical event processor, but you can replace the event processor, if you wish.</li>
<li>the internal macro QACTIVE_OSOBJECT_WAIT_() is now <a class="el" href="qk_8h.html#ae2426ed9b8543cbbccde98023d7773a7">QACTIVE_EQUEUE_WAIT_()</a>.</li>
<li>the internal macro QACTIVE_OSOBJECT_SIGNAL_() is now <a class="el" href="qk_8h.html#ad4ad4a29e36b9ad8e2aff0e7074c2a68">QACTIVE_EQUEUE_SIGNAL_()</a>.</li>
<li>the internal macro QACTIVE_OSOBJECT_ONIDLE_() is now QACTIVE_EQUEUE_ONEMPTY_().</li>
<li>the data members <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html#a36514f95c9255b2bcd867997886db588">QActive.osObject</a> and <a class="el" href="struct_q_active.html#a3c8614968d3a26c5cc52a033543b007c">QActive.thread</a> are now present only if the macros <a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html#a19f0d3c11e9df794d48ccfc37487062c" title="QActive &quot;OS-object&quot; type used in various QP/C ports.">QACTIVE_OS_OBJ_TYPE</a> and <a class="el" href="qp__port_8h.html#a22e7af26fda05aa0e0632bf17baa1e33" title="QActive &quot;thread&quot; type used in various QP/C ports.">QACTIVE_THREAD_TYPE</a> are defined.</li>

<li>the QPSet_hasElements() has been renamed QPSet64_notEmpty()</li>
<li>the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing is now better integrated with all QP components. You no longer need to explicitly include <a class="el" href="qs__port_8h.html" title="Sample QS/C port.">qs_port.h</a>, because it is automatically included when you define the macro <a class="el" href="cmd__options_8dox.html#a668b5df6d955d0b1c77227192078689b" title="The preprocessor switch to activate the QS software tracing instrumentation in QP/C and application c...">Q_SPY</a>.

<li>the new header file qvanilla.h now replaces the file qsched.h.</li>
<li>the file qa_ctor.c is now obsolete.</li>
<li>the macros QF_SCHED_LOCK() and QF_SCHED_UNLOCK() are now obsolete.</li>
<li>the native <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> event queues (both the active object event queues and the "raw" thread-safe queues) are slightly more efficient by counting down the head and tail pointers rather than up. This leads to wrap-around at zero, which is easier (faster) to test than any other wrap-around point. Also the native <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> event queues maintain the minimum of the free events in the queue rather the maximum of used events.</li>
<li>the data member of QEQueue.nTot class is removed.</li>
<li>the QF_publish() function has been re-written so that <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> no does <b>not need to lock the scheduler</b>. The QF_publish() function posts events to active objects with scheduler unlocked starting from the highest-priority active objects. However, the event is protected from inadvertent recycling by incrementing its reference counter before the publish operation. After the event is posted to all subscribers, the garbage collector QF_gc() is called to decrement the reference counter and recycle the event, if necessary.</li>
<li>the qf_run.c file is obsolete. The <a class="el" href="qutest_8c.html#a779a1bc9482e2d489dc87751cd100fdb">QF_run()</a> function for the cooperative "vanilla" kernel is now implemented in the file qvanilla.c.</li>
<li>the QF_tick() function has been rewritten to allow calling QF_tick() from the task context as well as from the interrupt context. The nested critical section around QF_tick() is no longer needed when it is called from the task level. Among others, this re-design <b>eliminates the need for the recursive</b> mutex in the POSIX <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> port.</li>
<li>the QMPool_init() function has been re-designed to optimally align the memory buffer in a portable and platform-independent way. This should bring some performance improvements on some CPUs (e.g., 80x86).</li>
<li>the extended <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> scheduler has been re-designed to save stack space. The extended context (e.g., coprocessor registers) are no longer saved on the precious stack, but rather in the active object.</li>
<li>a bug has been fixed in handling of Thread-Local Storage (TLS) in the <a class="el" href="struct_q_k.html" title="QK preemptive non-blocking kernel (QK namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QK</a> scheduler and extended scheduler.</li>
<li>the -q (quiet) flag has been added to the QSPY host application.</li>
<li>the support for two new compilers for Windows has been added for the QSPY host application. The application can now be build with the MinGW GNU compiler for Windows as well as the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005.</li>
<li>the QP port to Linux has been improved by eliminating the need for recursive P-Thread mutex.</li>
<li>the QP port to MicroC/OS-II has been upgraded to the latest version 2.86.</li>
<li>all examples in the standard QP distribution have been cleaned up and updated to the latest QP API changes.</li>
<li>all examples that use <a class="el" href="class_q_f.html" title="QF Active Object Framework (QF namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QF</a> now contain the <a class="el" href="struct_q_s.html" title="Software tracing instrumentation, target-resident component (QS namespace emulated as a &quot;class&quot; in C)">QS</a> software tracing support. </li>
